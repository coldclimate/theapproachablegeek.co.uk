title: Thoughts on leaving Facebook
---
It's two weeks since I pressed the button and deleted my Facebook account.  It's still sitting there, currently marked as "suspended" and will be for another 20 days or so until finally, hopefully, it is removed.  I was going to wait until then to post about the process but now feels like a good time.

## The road to awakening

I've thought about doing it for a little while and a few things added up to the end result of me deciding to go.  Amongst those were the following. 

I saw Aral Balkin speak at [Nine World](https://nineworlds.co.uk/2014/guest/aral-balkan) last summer and it set a lot of thoughts rumbling, thought they were mostly about business models for my side projects, but it planted a seed.  A seed that noodled about in my brain for the best part of a year.  

Working on a product for a couple of years that tracked what you did inside customers websites all be it in a very ethical way (I wouldn't have worked on it if it wasn't) opened my eyes to what can be tracked and how.  JavaScript is a wonderfully power tool.

[A brilliant piece](http://saintsal.com/facebook/) by Salim Virani popped up in my twitter stream and really rang a bell.  it's detail and the thought that had gone into Sal leaving made me realise how much he must have wanted to leave, because the process is not trivial.

## A moment of clarity

Finally, one Thursday night I was driving home and (being on autopilot) kicking about the idea of the Like Button.  It's ubiquitous across the net.  I've deployed or helped embed hundreds of instances, and each one is a little piece of JavaScript that shouts home to Facebook, figures out who you are, and shows you if any of your friends have liked this page.  Social proof is such a powerful motivator that embedding Like buttons is a no brainer in most cases, but think about what that little bit of JS is saying to FB even if you don't click it.. "Oli Wood is on www.abc.com/123 at this time, from this browser, in this location".  Yep that's right, Facebook is the ultimate cross site tracker.  Unless you log out, or run FB in a separate browser to everything, they know about just about everything you do online.

So I got home, did the very minimum to get my data out and pressed delete before I lost my bottle.  Then I emailed everybody who's details I'd extracted to tell them I'd left and where to find me.

## And so it begins

As a work colleague and self confessed grumpy man pointed out to me today "Who'd have thought leaving a website was such a big deal.  Imagine, "bloody hell, I've logged out of eBay!" being a big thing".  He's right.  Leaving a website shouldn't be a big thing, but leaving Facebook feels more like a death in the family at the moment.  I'm over exaggerating, but I've been astounded at the rollercoaster.

## A diary of withdrawal symptoms

* Thursday night: Elation, I'd actually done it, hitting delete actually bumped my heart rate.
* Friday morning: Work up, unlocked my phone, realized every single one of my shortcuts in Chrome was a Facebook URL.  Read email and Twitter and got up 15 minutes earlier than normal.
* Saturday and Sunday: Felt very disconnected and a bit lost.  Found myself taking my phone out of my pocket and putting it back numerous times.
* Monday though Thursday: Lots of discussion at work about why and how I left. 
* Friday night: The first time I've not spent half the night chatting to friend online whist watching films followed by seeing the early photos of people who've gone out.  Not this Friday however where I found myself feeling very disconnected.
* Week two felt much easier.  I found myself not picking up my phone every 10 minutes.  I got few personal emails which were lovely and bumped into a friend at tech meetup and actually had some stuff to talk about (normally I'd have known everything he had been up to).
* In the middle of the working day I got an email from FB telling me all my apps that I'd written had been taken offline and deauthorised.  I hope nobody was using them.

## And where now

So far, other than a bunch of birthdays (another think I forgot to export) I don't think I've missed out on anything (parties etc) but then who knows, you don't know what you don't know.  I have noticed my Twitter usage has gone up dramatically and I've logged back into a social network I only dipped into occasionally almost every day.  It's also lead me to thinking about how I got get what FB gave me, without FB.
