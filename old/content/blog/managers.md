title: Different types of manager
---

Just about everybody will have a manager at some point and recognising the type of manager you have can make a huge different. A little while ago I ran across this amazing tweet from [Caterina Fake](https://twitter.com/Caterina/status/6715084157) describing the three types of manager.  I'd like to add my own (seagull) and elaborate a little


# The S^%t Funnel
The Shit Funnel is the manager who takes all the shit, from wide and fan, and just funnels is straight down onto those who work for them.  At best a shit funnel is an inexperience manager who's under pressure.  At worst they are a dick.

# The S*&t Fan
The Shit Fan is a very different beast.  They're enthusiastic, full of energy, and completely ineffective.  When the shit hits The Fan it gets sprayed everywhere, covering all in it's way.  They add nothing, but they are trying.

# The S"Â£t Seagull
Every had your manager leave and they've not been replaced, instead you're now managed by their boss?  If it goes well all is well, but if not, you're about to get seagulled.  The seagull is that thing that floats around, high above, probably doing something important.  And them they shit on you, and you never see it coming, before they drift on.

# The S@~t Umbrella
The Shit Umbrella is what a manager should be.  They might be hard, you don't have to be friends, but they're there to shield you from all the shit that hits them.  Some of it will dribble down the handle, and you might have to work pretty hard to sort it, but they're you're best friend in the storm.
