Forget loosing weight or taking up a new hobby, in 2015 I'm going to stick to these instead.

* Anything new charges by USB. Standing USB (micro or mini), none of this custom bullshit
* Sell or recycle the old one.  I've no need for 3 old laptops, 2 cameras etc
* I'll get better at passwords, even if this means using a password manager.  There are no excuses
* Always use a unique email address for each service. As above, it's so easy there are no excuses
* Find a way to port my 2FA app between phones. Surely this is possible
* Sort out the home network/networking.  The rats nest under the telly must go
* Start to use the right tool for the job, not just smash with BASH
