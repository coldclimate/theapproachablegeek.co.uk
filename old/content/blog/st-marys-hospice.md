title: Raising money for St Mary's Hospice
---
Every few years I try to raise a chunk of money for a charity by doing something that scares me a little.  I've abseiled off the Tyne Bridge, zip-lined across the Tyne from the top of the Baltic Art Gallery and walked over fire.  All a little scary, but not too hard work.

This year I challenged myself to swim across Ullswater, and back, in my underware.  It was cold, tiring and actually pretty tough, but thanks to donations for friends and family we raised over Â£1,024 (my taregt) for [St Marys Hospice](http://www.stmaryshospice.org.uk/)

A few online tools made this job a lot easier.

Givey are company who make is super easy for companies to help support their employees charitable efforts.  After setting up [my page](https://www.givey.com/boyVlake) I didn't use it for that purpose but several of the donations through Givey were matched, doubling up the money nicely.  Givey also reads in the donations given through Just Giving too, making it an excellent place to point people.

If I'd been smarted I'd have coordinated my Givey Tag with my other hashtags, but I didn't notice until too late.

Just Giving has been around a long time and are an excellent online donation platform, making donations via PayPal and creditcards very easy.  I had planned to use the Just Giving page as a running log of my training only I completely failed to do much.  It would have been an excellent promotions tool if I had.

I linked in all of my profiles (Twiiter, Facebook etc) to my [Just Giving](http://www.justgiving.com/boy-verses-lake) page with a handy short URL.  This also makes it trivial to see which of my links was working best.  Just stick a + symbol on the end of the bit.ly link to see the [stats page](http://bitly.com/idiot-boy+)
