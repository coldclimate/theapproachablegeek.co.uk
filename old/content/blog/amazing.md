title: Amazing online customer service
---
A lot of people I know (mostly of a certain generation) still hesitate before buying online and often not because of fears of online security but customer service. “What do I di if it’s broken? How do I take it back to the shop?” are valid questions.

Some companies get this very wrong (Ebuyer, I am looking at you here) but just recently two suppliers have got it complete right.

I lost my [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/) whilst helping clear out the house of a deceased relative. It was on the other side of the country, and on a very stressful day, it’ probably got pinged off my trouser pocket whilst I was dragging a sofa round or something similar. I [tweeted about how sad I was](https://twitter.com/coldclimate/status/227656376950870016) when I noticed that evening.

Fitbit’s UK team [noticed and replied](https://twitter.com/FitbitUK/status/228055324760870912), suggesting I get in touch with their US support team. I dropped them a slightly confused email and a week later a brand new FitBit, exactly the same as the one I’d lost, came through my door. Amazing.

Last night I got home to my favorite surprise of the month, my [Larder Box](http://www.thelarderbox.com/). Larder Box is a subscription service who send you tasty treats every month. It’s an offshoot of Love Your Larder, a local start up. Sadly my Larder Box had not travelled well (I blame the delivery company here) and as a result the box was crushed on one side and the lid had come off the Bacon Jam resulting in a sticky mess. I dropped an email to Larder Box just to let them know (they should know if their delivery company has screwed up right?) and got a reply within minutes from the founder asking for a photo and saying a replacement box would be on it’s way to me asap.

Customer service isn’t lacking online, it’s thriving, and technologies such as Twitter, [Uservoice](http://uservoice.com/), [CustomerSure](http://customersure.com/) and plain old email are really helping to nail it. I can’t think of a shop who would have done what FitBit did for example.
