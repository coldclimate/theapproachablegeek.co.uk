title: Lessons Learnt - The Wall
---
A few months ago I started turning my Wall of Lessons into a series of blog posts.  I managed to write 2 in 3 months.  So instead I've bootstrapped the idea in the simplest way I know how - [A Flickr Set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliwood/sets/72157632451070129/)

Eventually I'll write all these up, but in the mean time they are all up there in their scrawled and messy state, for others to see.  I'll try and transcribe them into the comments now to ease your eyes.
