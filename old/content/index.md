title: The Approachable Geek
---

I’m Oli Wood and I'm a multi-disiplinary geek, primarily involved in version control, deployment, infrastructure and operations.  I've been working for technology firms since 1998 and have worked on projects ranging from two man bootstrapped start-ups to multi-million pound government projects.  This is mostly a home for my tech focused blog posts.


I started working in the digital world building websites for a glass firm in the late 90’s, you can find my employment history and hopefully a few nice words about me, on my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/oliwood).

Outside of work can normally be found listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen or attempting to grow apples and soft fruit.
