 <p class="created_at">2010-10-01</p>
 <p>I get asked whether or not I provide SEO services on a regular basis. I don‚Äôt, and I specifically choose not to. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with providing such services, but it is a minefield of snakeoil and difficult to judge value for money.  There are hundred of companies providing seo services, and some are good.  Most are providing limited benefits to people who think they need their help.</p>

<p>What is SEO?</p>

<p>It stands for Search Engine Optimisation and it started to come to the fore approximately 2001. By 2005 it was massive business. It‚Äôs the dark art of trying to get your website to the top of The Big Search Engines. At the moment, that means Google, and I‚Äôll use Google through this post, but it applies to all search engines. It can combine a variety of techniques ranging from the purely technical to the covert unethical. There is a good article and diagram of such things on eMarketing‚Äôs site. There is one mistake on it ‚Äì ‚Äúspam reporting competitors‚Äù is definetly not white hat (legit), and should be down in the black hat box.</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs the problem?</p>

<p>Most companies who approach me about SEO work have a problem that they want to solve. Either, they‚Äôve been told they need to include SEO in all quotes to do with web things (the danger of poor procurement) or they‚Äôre not seeing the traffic or sales they expect online and are attributing this to not ranking well on Google for their product area.</p>

<p>The reason why I turn down nearly all of this work is that there is a horrible simple truth, SEO is not a ‚Äúspray on‚Äù service. Your ranking in search engines is mostly down to your content, how the site has been coded, and what promotion work you‚Äôve been doing. Except in a few cases you can‚Äôt pay somebody to suddenly make you top of Google for ‚Äúcar leasing‚Äù (or whatever your business is.)</p>

<p>What can I do then?</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve commissioning a website, or in the process of having one built, this is the point you can do the most. Thinking of search engines as blind users is a good start, because this is effectively what they are. As a result images are not seen, JavaScript is not processed (so your AJAX interface might not be great) and Flash will be patchy (it has improved over the last few years).  Talk to your chosen developers about what they are specifically doing with SEO in mind.  It should not be a paid-for bolt on.</p>

<p>Content and content planning are key</p>

<p>Structure your website so that relevant content is in the same areas of the website, and that information is linked in a compelling way. Using words and phrases that are likely to be search for is a good start, and avoiding dated techniques such as ‚Äúclick here!‚Äù type links will help a great deal. There is an excellent primer on the subject of On Screen SEO available from Conversation Marketing</p>

<p>It is also worth thinking about your navigation on the site. Things that are hidden in databases are not as easily indexed by search engines, so as well as having a search facility to find things a solid cross-linking and discovery mechanism is needed. Here‚Äôs a whole wedge of good info about indexing the hidden web to read about.</p>

<p>Correct mark up is not technical gold plating</p>

<p>You webpage is probably being written in HTML, a few forgiving language. Poor quality developers can write HTML which is really poor quality, but your webbrowser will do everything it can to make sure that it displays. Great for you, terrible for the Internet at large. Invalid HTML will drop your search engine ranking and also provides a terrible user experience for people using older browsers or browsers for those who are differently abled. A good developer will do this as a matter of course, a poor one won‚Äôt understand why it is important. You can check the validity of your pages using W3C‚Äôs HTML validator. A word of warning, a single error will invalidate a page, but might be unavoidable (your CMS might have sneaked in something), but if you‚Äôre seeing lots of errors you‚Äôve got trouble. The homepage of The Approachable Geek has three errors at present. I‚Äôm not worried, but I will be fixing them.</p>

<p>Web addresses are really import</p>

<p>URL‚Äôs (web addresses) come in two flavour, those your can read, and those you can‚Äôt. The address for my article about online services (http://www.theapproachablegeek.co.uk/blog/using-online-services-to-help-run-your-business) page is human readable, and this is a good thing for everybody concerned. You can read it out down the phone. You know what it‚Äôs talking about just by reading it. Search engines understand what this page might be about because of the words in it. Geeks will get very excited at RESTful urls (and so they should, but most people won‚Äôt need to). I could talk about good URLs for hours (and have).</p>

<p>Then there are unreadable URLs. Sometime there are technically difficult to avoid, but most of the time they are the result of poor programming, old software (including some dreadful content management systems) or ill-thought-through ideas. They are dreadful for everybody concerned, because they do nothing that the good URLS did well in the previous paragraph. They also suck for your site‚Äôs rankings, because they are meaningless. Which would you rather see, http://www.theapproachablegeek.co.uk/blog/using-online-services-to-help-run-your-business or this one (name held to protect the innocent) http://www.reddacted.com/site/article_detail/item14169/?link_466=14169</p>

<p>New websites should have good URLs if the developers is any good. If your existing URLs are rubbish there may still be hope. Speak to a techy about ‚ÄúURL rewriting‚Äù and they should be able to help.</p>

<p>Submission and linking</p>

<p>How you are linked to, and how you link to people can have a great effect on your rankings. Avoid Click here links. Link in context, from words that say what the link is.</p>

<p>Building up inbound links to your site is a time consuming process, and is not always as productive as you might imagine. Try to get links from other relevant content, not just random sources. A link back to this site from an article about technical consultancy will be far more important to my ranking than a link from a blog I commented on off topic.</p>

<p>Never ever pay for mass linking services. Everyday I have hundred of spam comments left on my blogs linking back to people who have paid for thosands of links. They are spam, they count for nothing.</p>

<p>Do register you site in DMOZ the open directory. It might have been around for ever, but it really does carry some weight.</p>

<p>My site is already up and running and I‚Äôve got a problem, what can I do?</p>

<p>If your site has the two cardinal sins of invalid mark up and poor URL structure then talk to a technical company to see what they can do to help. It may not even be possible to sort out without rebuilding some or all of your site, and it certainly won‚Äôt be easy, but getting these two things fixed will make a huge difference.  Without them any ‚Äúoff page‚Äù SEO activities are unlikely to be much help</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre pages are valid and your URLs are up to scratch then you probably just need some help writing your content and structuring it, and could benefit from some link building.</p>

;"å	<h1><a href="/blog/hacking/">Hacking The Parliament</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2011-11-09</p>
 <p>I‚Äôm just back from a weekend long trip to London where I took part in <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/events/parliament">Rewired State‚Äôs Parliament Hack</a>.  It was a really fun weekend, starting off with a guided trip round the House of Commons and House of Lords (smaller than they look and with amazing streampunk-like brass speakers embedded into the benches) and then it was all back to The Guardian‚Äôs offices for 36 hours of code and collaboration.  First up through a rallying cry from Lord Jim Knight who turns out to be a very throughful fellow.</p>

<p>Parliament Hack was being run as part of <a href="http://www.parliamentweek.org/">Parliament Week</a> which aims to help people improve their understanding of both the parliament and democracy.  By opening up a bit of data and letting 40 or so geeks run riot over it a stack of projects were built that help people interact or understand the inner workings of our government a little better.</p>

"¬I‚Äôm just back from a weekend long trip to London where I took part in [Rewired State‚Äôs Parliament Hack](http://rewiredstate.org/events/parliament).  It was a really fun weekend, starting off with a guided trip round the House of Commons and House of Lords (smaller than they look and with amazing streampunk-like brass speakers embedded into the benches) and then it was all back to The Guardian‚Äôs offices for 36 hours of code and collaboration.  First up through a rallying cry from Lord Jim Knight who turns out to be a very throughful fellow.

Parliament Hack was being run as part of [Parliament Week](http://www.parliamentweek.org/) which aims to help people improve their understanding of both the parliament and democracy.

;";<h1><a href="/blog/building/">Is the digital industry like the building trade?</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-05-31</p>
 <p>Just lately I‚Äôve been having problems in my house, I‚Äôve had a new shower put in, and before the weather gets rubbish, I‚Äôll need a new kitchen putting in too.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been putting all this off for a while, but eventually the cold showers in the morning forced me into finding somebody, and whilst it all went ok, I suddenly realised how much the IT industry (or the Digital Sector as we all seem to be called now), is like the building trade.</p>

<p>You can normally muddle through</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of finding somebody, getting my shower fixed, taking time of work to be there and then the hassle of dealing with cash (funny how so many people work in cash).  I put up with a cold shower for months, and I‚Äôm still muddling through with my kitchen.</p>

<p>It problems are pretty much the same, you can normally muddle through.  Just look at the number of websites hosted on free servers and thus cluttered with adverts, or how many businesses have mail@mywebsite.com only to reply from hotmail addresses when you do get in touch.  There‚Äôs a lovely poster from The Oatmeal about email addresses.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard, so you put it off, just like I‚Äôll do in my kitchen until the bucket under the sink overflows.</p>

<p>Finding people</p>

<p>Actually tracking down people is a nightmare.  You‚Äôvea rough idea what you need, but who do you hire?  I asked Twitter about electricians in Gateshead and a very nice fella came out and connected a wire form my cooker to the wall.  So far so good. Sadly not all recommendations work out so well.</p>

<p>There are now starting to be online services to find plumbers, builders, tilers etc such as mybuilder.com but when I used the service it only worked out ok, not brilliantly for me.</p>

<p>Knowing what to ask for</p>

<p>One of my major problems was knowing what to ask for.  I knew what I wanted (‚Äúa hot shower in the morning please‚Äù) and I‚Äôd bought a replacement shower (I did a little homework, found what I needed, and bought direct thinking this would save me money), but who did I need to fit it, a plumber (it does involve water), n electrician (it‚Äôs an electric shower after all), a tiler (because those nastytimes were going to get pulled off, maybe a builder would take care of this for me?</p>

<p>It turned out I needed all three of those things, but I only found that out after 3 guys turned up to fit it.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre pretty sure you‚Äôre going to be ripped off</p>

<p>Even if you‚Äôve gota good idea what you need, and you‚Äôve found somebody to do it, you still feel like you‚Äôre getting ripped off.  Even when you‚Äôve got a perfectly satisfactory job done, it still seems fairly expensive.  The same is true of dealing with lawyers, dentists and even gardeners.  When you look at the day rate of running a business, charging ¬£500 a day is maybe not unreasonable, but it‚Äôs not cheap.</p>

<p>Variable cost of jobs</p>

<p>Getting my shower fitted is a prime example. Quoted cost (job unseen) was ¬£85 which seemed reasonable.  Except then on inspection it turned out the wiring for my house is too old, and thus I needed a new Widget, and that was ¬£180, and the extra time for somebody to put that in was ¬£X.  All said and done, it was ¬£450 on the day,plus the cost of the shower.</p>

<p>I know a little bit about electical systems, and this was all fair, so I ended up paying out, but if the builder who does my kitchen says I need a new Dongle or DoDad, I‚Äôm stuck.  I probably do, and I‚Äôll be happy to pay, but I‚Äôll always have that feeling that I could have just been ripped off.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs impossible to quote most jobs until you get under the hood of the problem, and the digital industry is no different.  You‚Äôve really no idea how difficult most problems are until you get in there and have a go.  Luckily we can prototype, a luxury not afforded to the building trade.</p>

<p>Kitchens pricing is a bit of a nightmare too.  You can spend anywhere from a couple of hundred to tens of thousands, and what you get for your money is probably a hundred times better.  There‚Äôs no good answer to ‚Äúhow much does a new kitchen cost‚Äù just like there is no easy answer to the question ‚Äúhow much does a website cost‚Äù.  A brilliant little project called Internet Online Website helped explain this to so many of my old clients.</p>

<p>Trusting people in your house</p>

<p>My biggest worry about getting my kitchen sorted, apart from the cost, and finding somebody, is having people in my house.  I hate the idea that somebody might have been thought my stuff whilst I was out, and thus I shall be working from home when anybody is about, even if the electricity is off, and the water, and the air is thick with dust.</p>

<p>I never let other people use my laptop, or very rarely, ever since a housemate at university borrowed my desktop for an evening to produce his CV, and I found lots of mystuff had been opened up (the power of ‚ÄúRecent items‚Äù in Windows 95 became apparent).  Trusting people with your private stuff is really hard.</p>

<p>The importance of finishing up</p>

<p>After my shower was fitted, I was dead chuffed.  I stood under it until I nearly disolved, luxuriating in the heat and power.  Then I noticed a smear of sealant down the side of the bath. Such things happen, and it being white on white, it probably didn‚Äôt show up.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of days lots of little things showed up though, from grout all round my plug chain (annoying) to the fact that the plaster dust had been swept up but out into the corridor which is carpeted (destructive).</p>

<p>Cleaning up after a job and handing over successfully is key to a client thinking well of you after you leave, from documentation to support contracts, finishing up is everything.</p>

<p>Did they nick your keys?</p>

<p>Finally the job is done.You‚Äôve paid, you‚Äôve left feedback if required and all is well, but these guys had access to your entire house for a week, did they get a copy of your keys cut?  There‚Äôs nothing stopping them physically (there‚Äôs even a key cutting place at the end of my road) after all.  Professional trust, respect and reputation are all that stop them from coming back.</p>

<p>You could change your locks, but do you know how?  Passwords and rootkits are much the same,sadly.</p>

<p>The need for a friendly ear</p>

<p>To help me though my kitchen dilemma, I have my brother.  He‚Äôs a builder, and whilst he‚Äôs not going to do the work (never work and family in my book) he came round, had a good poke about, and gave me an idea of what needed doing and roughly what it might cost.  I bought him a beer, but I‚Äôd have happily paid for a couple of hours of his time, just like I do with my accountant.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs not about to sell me one thing, he‚Äôll have a poke about and see if some of the gotcha‚Äôs are there, and if he knew a man who he rated, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd have put me in touch.</p>

<p>Hopefully The Approachable Geek is to small businesses what my brother is to my kitchen problem.</p>

 <p>Just lately I‚Äôve been having problems in my house, I‚Äôve had a new shower put in, and before the weather gets rubbish, I‚Äôll need a new kitchen putting in too.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been putting all this off for a while, but eventually the cold showers in the morning forced me into finding somebody, and whilst it all went ok, I suddenly realised how much the IT industry (or the Digital Sector as we all seem to be called now), is like the building trade.</p>

<p>You can normally muddle through</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of finding somebody, getting my shower fixed, taking time of work to be there and then the hassle of dealing with cash (funny how so many people work in cash).  I put up with a cold shower for months, and I‚Äôm still muddling through with my kitchen.</p>

<p>It problems are pretty much the same, you can normally muddle through.  Just look at the number of websites hosted on free servers and thus cluttered with adverts, or how many businesses have mail@mywebsite.com only to reply from hotmail addresses when you do get in touch.  There‚Äôs a lovely poster from The Oatmeal about email addresses.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard, so you put it off, just like I‚Äôll do in my kitchen until the bucket under the sink overflows.</p>

<p>Finding people</p>

<p>Actually tracking down people is a nightmare.  You‚Äôvea rough idea what you need, but who do you hire?  I asked Twitter about electricians in Gateshead and a very nice fella came out and connected a wire form my cooker to the wall.  So far so good. Sadly not all recommendations work out so well.</p>

<p>There are now starting to be online services to find plumbers, builders, tilers etc such as mybuilder.com but when I used the service it only worked out ok, not brilliantly for me.</p>

<p>Knowing what to ask for</p>

<p>One of my major problems was knowing what to ask for.  I knew what I wanted (‚Äúa hot shower in the morning please‚Äù) and I‚Äôd bought a replacement shower (I did a little homework, found what I needed, and bought direct thinking this would save me money), but who did I need to fit it, a plumber (it does involve water), n electrician (it‚Äôs an electric shower after all), a tiler (because those nastytimes were going to get pulled off, maybe a builder would take care of this for me?</p>

<p>It turned out I needed all three of those things, but I only found that out after 3 guys turned up to fit it.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre pretty sure you‚Äôre going to be ripped off</p>

<p>Even if you‚Äôve gota good idea what you need, and you‚Äôve found somebody to do it, you still feel like you‚Äôre getting ripped off.  Even when you‚Äôve got a perfectly satisfactory job done, it still seems fairly expensive.  The same is true of dealing with lawyers, dentists and even gardeners.  When you look at the day rate of running a business, charging ¬£500 a day is maybe not unreasonable, but it‚Äôs not cheap.</p>

<p>Variable cost of jobs</p>

<p>Getting my shower fitted is a prime example. Quoted cost (job unseen) was ¬£85 which seemed reasonable.  Except then on inspection it turned out the wiring for my house is too old, and thus I needed a new Widget, and that was ¬£180, and the extra time for somebody to put that in was ¬£X.  All said and done, it was ¬£450 on the day,plus the cost of the shower.</p>

<p>I know a little bit about electical systems, and this was all fair, so I ended up paying out, but if the builder who does my kitchen says I need a new Dongle or DoDad, I‚Äôm stuck.  I probably do, and I‚Äôll be happy to pay, but I‚Äôll always have that feeling that I could have just been ripped off.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs impossible to quote most jobs until you get under the hood of the problem, and the digital industry is no different.  You‚Äôve really no idea how difficult most problems are until you get in there and have a go.  Luckily we can prototype, a luxury not afforded to the building trade.</p>

<p>Kitchens pricing is a bit of a nightmare too.  You can spend anywhere from a couple of hundred to tens of thousands, and what you get for your money is probably a hundred times better.  There‚Äôs no good answer to ‚Äúhow much does a new kitchen cost‚Äù just like there is no easy answer to the question ‚Äúhow much does a website cost‚Äù.  A brilliant little project called Internet Online Website helped explain this to so many of my old clients.</p>

<p>Trusting people in your house</p>

<p>My biggest worry about getting my kitchen sorted, apart from the cost, and finding somebody, is having people in my house.  I hate the idea that somebody might have been thought my stuff whilst I was out, and thus I shall be working from home when anybody is about, even if the electricity is off, and the water, and the air is thick with dust.</p>

<p>I never let other people use my laptop, or very rarely, ever since a housemate at university borrowed my desktop for an evening to produce his CV, and I found lots of mystuff had been opened up (the power of ‚ÄúRecent items‚Äù in Windows 95 became apparent).  Trusting people with your private stuff is really hard.</p>

<p>The importance of finishing up</p>

<p>After my shower was fitted, I was dead chuffed.  I stood under it until I nearly disolved, luxuriating in the heat and power.  Then I noticed a smear of sealant down the side of the bath. Such things happen, and it being white on white, it probably didn‚Äôt show up.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of days lots of little things showed up though, from grout all round my plug chain (annoying) to the fact that the plaster dust had been swept up but out into the corridor which is carpeted (destructive).</p>

<p>Cleaning up after a job and handing over successfully is key to a client thinking well of you after you leave, from documentation to support contracts, finishing up is everything.</p>

<p>Did they nick your keys?</p>

<p>Finally the job is done.You‚Äôve paid, you‚Äôve left feedback if required and all is well, but these guys had access to your entire house for a week, did they get a copy of your keys cut?  There‚Äôs nothing stopping them physically (there‚Äôs even a key cutting place at the end of my road) after all.  Professional trust, respect and reputation are all that stop them from coming back.</p>

<p>You could change your locks, but do you know how?  Passwords and rootkits are much the same,sadly.</p>

<p>The need for a friendly ear</p>

<p>To help me though my kitchen dilemma, I have my brother.  He‚Äôs a builder, and whilst he‚Äôs not going to do the work (never work and family in my book) he came round, had a good poke about, and gave me an idea of what needed doing and roughly what it might cost.  I bought him a beer, but I‚Äôd have happily paid for a couple of hours of his time, just like I do with my accountant.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs not about to sell me one thing, he‚Äôll have a poke about and see if some of the gotcha‚Äôs are there, and if he knew a man who he rated, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd have put me in touch.</p>

<p>Hopefully The Approachable Geek is to small businesses what my brother is to my kitchen problem.</p>

 <p>For the last couple of months I‚Äôve been spending one evening a week working with Judith O‚ÄôReilly (better known as <a href="http://www.wifeinthenorth.com/">Wife in the North</a>) running a short course through Newcastle University <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ncla/events/item/blog-it">all about blogging</a>. We‚Äôve had a small class with a mix of people ranging from complete newbies to people running some well establish blogs, nearly all ladies, ranging in age from early twenties to an early retiree.</p>

<p>Whenever I mention things like ‚Äúteaching blogging‚Äù or introductions to social media all of my tech friend sneer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy‚Äù, ‚Äúyou just do it‚Äù and ‚Äúit can‚Äôt be taught‚Äù are phrases I‚Äôve heard time and time again.  Annoyingly they are sort of right too, but what they don‚Äôt give credit to is that all of these things can be really intimidating for people who don‚Äôt live their entire lives online.  That‚Äôs where I come in, to provide a guidance, a bit of non-patronising hand holding, and some practical help if people are stuck.  I don‚Äôt pretend to have all the answers, and in many cases there is no one right way to do it (though there are often lots of examples of how not to do it).  I‚Äôm there to facilitate, not dictate.</p>

<p>Being no writer I was handling the ‚Äútech side‚Äù of blogging, from getting started on Blogger.com, wordpress.com (and a few others), though RSS, linking, embedding media, building an audience, blogging for business and finally a little about SEO and monetization. Being a writer Judith was working with students to improve their content, writing style and other such things.</p>

<p>Over the course of the 6 weeks I‚Äôve learnt a lot, although most of it was how to do IT support for an entire class all on different kit and how badly the universities are set up to provide courses outside of office hours (no IT support after 5pm means all visiting teaching staff are on their own!) I‚Äôve also got a lot better at helping to demystify some of the complexities of this internet thing too I hope.</p>

<p>Practical things aside, I‚Äôve been amazed at the posts that my class have produced. I really enjoyed the first few posts from <a href="The Reluctant Buddhist">The Reluctant Buddhist</a>, who sadly didn‚Äôt write a huge amount more. <a href="http://theanticsofabrittleasthmatic.blogspot.com/2011/05/black-blood.html">A post about self harming</a> on the Antics Of A Brittle Asthmatic is a truly seductive and moving piece of writing. Little insights into the world of <a href="http://www.estateliving.co.uk/blog/">Estate Living</a> have been really interesting (and I love ‚Äúthe view from the farm‚Äù snippet written in the persona of an animal in each one). I‚Äôm also hopeful that <a href="http://musicianversusstudent.blogspot.com/">Musician Verses Student</a> blossoms into an awesome online juxtaposition of lifestyles.</p>

<p>All of the students who stuck with the course right through produced work I was proud of, and I hope that they‚Äôve found a sense of self confidence and assurity that means they will carry on blogging, either in their current guises or in new projects.</p>

;"<h1><a href="/blog/redis/">Dabbling with Redis</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2011-11-25</p>
 <p>Over the last few years I‚Äôve heard more and more about NOSQL (Not Only SQL, not No SQL) techniques and technologies but had limited time to experiment.  Luckily a project came along which was a perfect fit for making use of two, MongoDB and Redis. It‚Äôs taken me a little bit of time to start to get my head around either but Redis specifically has helped unlock a whole swath of interesting bits and pieces.</p>

<p>Redis is a key-value store, making is very fast and easy to push bits of data into a store without them having to fit into a per-defined schema.  It‚Äôs got great drivers for all of the languages I work in too as well as a command line interface.  Getting it up and running was reasonably simple thanks for Ubuntu‚Äôs apt-get command.  There are numerous great guides to Redis, what it does and how to get  started out there.</p>

<p>None of this will be anything new to hardcore geeks, but what surprised me was how I‚Äôve ended up using Redis over the last few months.</p>

<p>A quick, dirty and brilliant cross program message queue</p>

<p>I suddenly found myself using Redis as a job queue thanks to it‚Äôs easy lists.  I can push driver values into a list with one process and pop them out from another.  You can use it as a First In Last Out stack by pushing and popping from the same end of the list, or as a First In First Out queue by pushing onto one end and popping from the other.

<p>Lets start with their default browsers.

Just about every action seems to trigger a vastly over-dire warning box to pop up along the lines of ‚ÄúYou will contract a virus in the next 3 minutes unless you update Power Ultra Virus Scanner Pro from XXXXX‚Äù (where XXXXX is the vendor of the laptop/crapware/super market where they bought it.

 <p class="created_at">2011-08-06</p>
 <p>I‚Äôve just got to the weekend on the end of one of the busiest weeks of my life, and one of the most satisfying.  A few months ago I ran across <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/">Young Rewrited State</a> (I‚Äôve previously been involved with Rewired State), and decided that an event had to happen in Newcastle (the closest one to here was Manchester).

<p>This post completely fails to capture just how blown away I was not only with the young developers who attended the Newcastle event but with those whom I watched present on the live stream too.  It‚Äôs the most amazing and humbling thing to watch a bunch of people more than half your age knock spots off you not only technically but also in their ability to learn and adapt.</p>

<p>YRS is a week long event when volunteers (known as mentors) help a bunch of young developers (not kids, never call these guys kids) to use <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">open data</a> to build stuff.  Many of those taking part have never programmed before, some are already (at 15) old hands and show me up. At the end of the week they all truck down to London for a big show and tell (with prizes).</p>

<p>The Centre for Life here in Newcastle hosted us for the whole week and moved mountains to get the internet access we needed (slow connections are the bane of every developers life).  We were based out in the middle of a science museum too, rather than locked away, which was very cool.</p>

<p>Over the course of the week 7 guys under the age of 18 formed teams and with the help of 7 mentors, formed teams and build 4 stand alone projects, either in completed form, or as worked through and credible mockups.  We had a location aware iPhone app to help people make smart choices about their renewable energy decisions, a platform game where the display and the difficulty were influenced by weather and crime data, a fully working Google Earth implementation that mapped school results against voting records to look for correlations and a fully working <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ablnbokolnpjfcnpkebgjckodjljegih?">Google Chrome QR</a> code plugin (built by two guys who‚Äôd never programmed anything at all).</p>

<p>Sadly I couldn‚Äôt make it to London to watch the pitches but I watch the live stream for as much of the day as possible (the recordings are online).  I‚Äôm never been so flabbergasted in my life.

A few months ago I ran across [Young Rewrited State](http://youngrewiredstate.org/) (I‚Äôve previously been involved with Rewired State), and decided that an event had to happen in Newcastle (the closest one to here was Manchester).  There‚Äôs an excellent write up of the whole thing over on [The Journal](http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/science-and-technology/2011/08/11/youngsters-plug-into-coding-the-centre-for-life-51140-29213126/2/).

This post completely fails to capture just how blown away I was not only with the young developers who attended the Newcastle event but with those whom I watched present on the live stream too.  It‚Äôs the most amazing and humbling thing to watch a bunch of people more than half your age knock spots off you not only technically but also in their ability to learn and adapt.

YRS is a week long event when volunteers (known as mentors) help a bunch of young developers (not kids, never call these guys kids) to use [open data](http://data.gov.uk/) to build stuff.  Many of those taking part have never programmed before, some are already (at 15) old hands and show me up. At the end of the week they all truck down to London for a big show and tell (with prizes).

The Centre for Life here in Newcastle hosted us for the whole week and moved mountains to get the internet access we needed (slow connections are the bane of every developers life).  We were based out in the middle of a science museum too, rather than locked away, which was very cool.

Over the course of the week 7 guys under the age of 18 formed teams and with the help of 7 mentors, formed teams and build 4 stand alone projects, either in completed form, or as worked through and credible mockups.  We had a location aware iPhone app to help people make smart choices about their renewable energy decisions, a platform game where the display and the difficulty were influenced by weather and crime data, a fully working Google Earth implementation that mapped school results against voting records to look for correlations and a fully working [Google Chrome QR](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ablnbokolnpjfcnpkebgjckodjljegih?) code plugin (built by two guys who‚Äôd never programmed anything at all).

Sadly I couldn‚Äôt make it to London to watch the pitches but I watch the live stream for as much of the day as possible (the recordings are online).  I‚Äôm never been so flabbergasted in my life. Most of the teams presenting knocked the spots of several start up companies I could name, and seeing an 8 year old hand a government official his ass on a plate for the state of their public data was priceless.

One of the judges was [Mike Butcher](http://eu.techcrunch.com/author/mike-butcher/) from [TechCrunch EU](http://eu.techcrunch.com/).  His tweet through the day ay it all for me.

;"î<h1><a href="/blog/twitter-for-authors/">Twitter for authors, a session for New Writing North</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-10-21</p>
 <p>In October 2010 I delivered a half day session at the amazing Newcastle Library on behalf of New Writing North to a group of authors interested in getting started with Twitter and using it more effectively.</p>

<p>The Newcastle Library for those who‚Äôve not been, is an amazing new building, and quite the busiest library I‚Äôve ever seen. As a dedicated reader it warms my heart to see not just the computers getting used, but plenty of people missing about the stacks. The staff too were extreamly helpful getting me signed up, and thus signed into their wifi.</p>

<p>As it turned out all of the authors in attendance were already signed up for Twitter and had accounts, so the test accounts I have available for people to play with and learn on were not needed. They were all however a little hazy on the fine details of the difference between tweets, re-tweets, the subtleties involved in @replies and hashtags. We also covered things like geolocation (new that week to Twitter) and New Twitter, which is still in it‚Äôs early stages.</p>

<p>The session was designed not just to introduce Twitter and how to use it, but also to look into some of the writing projects that are going on via twitter at the moment includes dinnerguest, goodcaptain and the proliferation of Haiku in 140 characters of less. A good deal of the session was also used to cover how authors, who are in effect small businesses, could use twitter to help promote their work</p>

<p>All in all a very successful day, and nice to meet a few new faces too.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/reusing-hardware/">Reusing old hardware to get a webcam online</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-11-02</p>
 <p>As an afternoon project, I‚Äôve been using some old kit I had in the office to get a webcam up and running pointing at my birdfeeder.  It‚Äôs a trial run for a client doing something simalar.  The quality to terrible because it‚Äôs an old ¬£6 webcam, but the idea would work.</p>

<p>The kit:</p>

<p>An old Toshiba Tecra laptop, circa 1998.  It has USB ports, but no network interface or wireless.
An unbranded webcam
An Xubuntu install CD
A USB wifi adaptor I got free with the router
Duct-tape
I plugged the webcam and WiFi adaptor into the laptop (currently running Windows 95), popped the XUbuntu CD in it‚Äôs drive, and rebooted, removing Windows for ever.  Ubuntu took a while to install, but having the webcam and WiFi plugged in at install time meant the drivers got installed and it happy connected to my internet connection.</p>

<p>Firstly I installed Cheese, which is very handy for debugging the webcam.  Luckily, I quickly got a picture, so I placed the webcam where it could see the birdfeeder, and added a bit of duct tape to hold it in place.  Once that was in place I installed streamer, which lets you capture images from the webcam as still images. Lastly I installed sshfs which lets me access my webhosting securely, as if it was a local disk.  This makes moving the images around a lot easier.</p>

<p>Unfortunately sshfs mounts time out eventually, and I didn‚Äôt find a why to solve it, so I ended up replacing the upload mechanism with ssh keyless logins and scp. The trick to making it work was the last addition to this article about ssh-agent</p>

<p>Next it‚Äôs time for a bit of automation.  First I knocked up a script which called streamer, takes a picture, adds a timestamp to each image using ImageMagik, replaces the existing current image (imaginatively called current.jpeg) and then copies it to the remote website.  Then I added a crontab entry to call this script every five minutes.  It‚Äôs also limited only being on between the hours of 5am and 6pm, because it‚Äôs pretty dark otherwise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written all the details of how I did this using Dropbox and another old laptop over on coldclimate.co.uk where I blog persoanlly.  All the scripts you need are there too.</p>

<p>Now I have an image file on my web hosting here at The Approachable Geek which is updated every five minutes, showing the feeder.  Hopefully you‚Äôll spot something fun on there! Due to the orientation of the house the late afternoon sun will just about wipe out the picture.</p>

Then I added a crontab entry to call this script every five minutes.  It‚Äôs also limited only being on between the hours of 5am and 6pm, because it‚Äôs pretty dark otherwise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written all the details of how I did this using Dropbox and another old laptop over on coldclimate.co.uk where I blog persoanlly.  All the scripts you need are there too.</p>

<p>Now I have an image file on my web hosting here at The Approachable Geek which is updated every five minutes, showing the feeder.  Hopefully you‚Äôll spot something fun on there! Due to the orientation of the house the late afternoon sun will just about wipe out the picture.</p>

"î	As an afternoon project, I‚Äôve been using some old kit I had in the office to get a webcam up and running pointing at my birdfeeder.  It‚Äôs a trial run for a client doing something simalar.  The quality to terrible because it‚Äôs an old ¬£6 webcam, but the idea would work.

The kit:

An old Toshiba Tecra laptop, circa 1998.  It has USB ports, but no network interface or wireless.
An unbranded webcam
An Xubuntu install CD
A USB wifi adaptor I got free with the router
Duct-tape
I plugged the webcam and WiFi adaptor into the laptop (currently running Windows 95), popped the XUbuntu CD in it‚Äôs drive, and rebooted, removing Windows for ever.  Ubuntu took a while to install, but having the webcam and WiFi plugged in at install time meant the drivers got installed and it happy connected to my internet connection.

Firstly I installed Cheese, which is very handy for debugging the webcam.  Luckily, I quickly got a picture, so I placed the webcam where it could see the birdfeeder, and added a bit of duct tape to hold it in place.  Once that was in place I installed streamer, which lets you capture images from the webcam as still images. Lastly I installed sshfs which lets me access my webhosting securely, as if it was a local disk.  This makes moving the images around a lot easier.

Unfortunately sshfs mounts time out eventually, and I didn‚Äôt find a why to solve it, so I ended up replacing the upload mechanism with ssh keyless logins and scp. The trick to making it work was the last addition to this article about ssh-agent

Next it‚Äôs time for a bit of automation.  First I knocked up a script which called streamer, takes a picture, adds a timestamp to each image using ImageMagik, replaces the existing current image (imaginatively called current.jpeg) and then copies it to the remote website.  Then I added a crontab entry to call this script every five minutes.  It‚Äôs also limited only being on between the hours of 5am and 6pm, because it‚Äôs pretty dark otherwise.

I‚Äôve written all the details of how I did this using Dropbox and another old laptop over on coldclimate.co.uk where I blog persoanlly.  All the scripts you need are there too.

Now I have an image file on my web hosting here at The Approachable Geek which is updated every five minutes, showing the feeder.  Hopefully you‚Äôll spot something fun on there!

 <p class="created_at">2010-09-03</p>
 <p>Recently a client caused me to scratch my head and have to put my thinking cap on. How do you make the most of the 11,000 photos they‚Äôve taken over the last 6 years to help promote their business and find the value in a record of their work. I‚Äôll cover what we did another day, because getting to grips with the photos was the first big problem.</p>

<p>As we all do (and I‚Äôm guilty of this) they‚Äôd not done anything about keeping their photos organised. 3 different cameras, 4 different computers and countless people over the years had resulted in duplication, miss-filing (some attempt had been made to put all of the photos about a subject into a folder), and worst of all, missing files.</p>

<p>Using a set of command line tools we were able to find all of the pictures on all the different computers, and copy them all into one place (a huge external hard drive). Now we had everything in one place we could start removing the duplicates and grouping the photos. A combination of tools (exiftool, find, grep, and bash scripting) renamed all of the pictures to the date they were taken on, and by grouping then by time we could then file them by client, spotting where one client‚Äôs photos had been plonked into another client. Where files were duplicates, they had the same name, so identifying them was reasonably easy.</p>

<p>Lastly, we‚Äôre now working on a filing system that is not just client based. For example the client might want to find all photos with Terracotta pots in them, hard landscaping, or crambe maritima (they are landscape gardeners after all). The answer is finding a piece of software which supports tagging. We‚Äôll file photos by client but tag them with subjects. It‚Äôs got to work on both Windows and Apple OS X, and play nicely with the distributed file system (provided by DropBox). It looks like Picasa might be the answer, but we‚Äôre still trailing it.</p>

<p>A few things you can do right now to help sort out your photos right now‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Set the date and time on your camera, so the embedded EXIF data is better
Turn on geolocation if your camera supports it
Get into the habit of dumping all the pictures off the camera and then sorting them right away, then deleting the photos off the camera. You‚Äôll end up with duplicates otherwise.
Set the filenames on your cameras to different things ‚ÄúbigSLR‚Äù and ‚ÄúpointShoot‚Äù for example. This means that your photos will have different file names, bigSLR001.jpg for example. Reduces duplication and lets you work out what something is.
Back up, back up and back up, but don‚Äôt just duplicate on the same computer. Use a tool like Rsync, to synchronise pictures onto an external disk or another computer.
If you‚Äôre a photo professional, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre using Lightroom, which does a lot of this for you.</p>

;"¯"<h1><a href="/blog/habit/">A creature of habit</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2012-06-18</p>
 <p>A few weeks ago Joel Gascoigne,a chap who I‚Äôve really come to admire since I first ran across him 18 months ago wrote a brilliant blog post about building an excerise habit.  I‚Äôm yet to get regular exercise into my routine (I will, I‚Äôve identified the slot in the day), but it reminded me of a post I wrote years ago about having a daily routine.  Over the intervening years my routine has changed, and I thought it was time to rewrite the post.</p>

<p>I might work on a wide range of things in a day, but my day to day routine is pretty set. and this helps me enormously.</p>

<p>The night before‚Ä¶</p>

<p>My day starts the night before with checking my calendar for tomorrow.  A quick check gives me the heads up about the upcoming day (and week really).  More than once it‚Äôs saved my life, reminding me I need to be in another city, or that something critical has to happen that has slipped my mind.  I know people who put off looking at the diary until the day in question fearing they‚Äôll dwell on it over night, and occasionally this does happen, but rarely.  The more I do it, the better it gets.</p>

<p>The waking dead</p>

<p>My alarm goes off at the same time every day (except weekend), 6:45.  I‚Äôm slowly creeping this time earlier in an effort to find more day.  It‚Äôs in another room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off (or I just fall sleep again).</p>

<p>From turning the alarm off I stagger into the bathroom and (starting last week) stand on my Aria Scales.  I‚Äôve been a FitBitter for nearly a year and find that tracking things reinforces good habits.  Weight myself at the same time, in the same condition (naked and half asleep) every day gives me consistency between my weight and body fat percentage results.</p>

<p>Standing under the shower and attempting to wake up I run though things from the calendar the night before.  Sometimes I can‚Äôt remember anything, which is normally a good sign.</p>

<p>Let the train bus take the strain</p>

<p>I stopped commuting by car at the beginning for the year because of a change of circumstance and thus now commute by bus.  The unexpected consequence of this is that I am more productive, something I didn‚Äôt see coming.  I walk up to the bus stop reading my emails on my phone, it‚Äôs only 5 minutes of walking but this is enough time to scan read everything.  This gives me a heads up on any overnight or unplanned (calendared) work.  It also sets me up for the first call of the day.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm lucky enough to live on the confluence of five bus routes, so it‚Äôs never very long before one comes also.  Having an electronic bus pass that direct debits my account removes the need to always have change on me.  Over the last few years I‚Äôve worked to make my life as hassle free as possible, and getting organised enough to sort out a monthly pass makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Whilst on the bus I ring, or am rang by, The CEO of CANDDi.  It‚Äôs around 7:30 every day, give or take 5 minutes.  We work through the day before, the plans for today, some personal stuff (we‚Äôve known each other for a good few years) and some personal development stuff. It normally goes on until I reach my destination (10 minutes down the line) and beyond.</p>

<p>I get off the bus 15 minutes walk from the Ignite 100 office where I work.  I love spending time in a co-working space, more on that another day.  the 15 minute walk is just enough to wake up up, get the blood pumping and nail off the day with Tim.  I‚Äôve normally got a todo list by the end of the call and Tim emails me it back if needed  (he‚Äôs sitting on a train using an iPad when talking to me, note taking is easier for him).</p>

<p>If I‚Äôve not reached the office by now I normally have a scroll through Twitter about now.</p>

<p>A space to get work done</p>

<p>Once hitting the office I always take the lift up to the top floor.  The rest of the day I‚Äôll use the stairs (a FitBit induced habit) but right now there‚Äôs only one thing on my mind, the first coffee of the day.  I‚Äôve not eaten at this point, and that caffeine hit is the kick start I need.</p>

<p>Setting up the day</p>

<p>Over coffee I get the my laptop fired up.  It lives in the office Mon to Fri (dodgy back habit ‚Äì only carry what you need to), helping to enforce a little bit of home/office separation.  Some day I‚Äôve blog about my homebrew ergonomic setup, but not right now.  This time is used for setting up the day for the people who report to me, so I can get on with work whilst they do.  I spend 15 minutes or so working through the LightHouse tickets raised since I last look, allocating them to a bucket (this week‚Äôs work or ‚Äúto plan‚Äù) and a person (the one who will do the actual work).  Sometimes that even means assigning tickets to myself (Coding! Awesome!)</p>

<p>I then work through my daily tasks, checking the server logs from last night (must find a better way to do this), popping an eye into Munin, etc etc.  It takes time, it rarely shows anything critical, but it‚Äôs extremely reassuring. Once I‚Äôve done it I know that the technology and thus the business, are ok.</p>

<p>Beginning last week we have started having a daily 15 minute scrum meeting on Skype. I‚Äôll see how this goes and blog about it later.</p>

<p>Tomato driven development</p>

<p>Through the day, especially on coding days, I try to work in Pomodoros.  25 minute focused sprints of work, with 5 minutes in between each. Sometimes it works and sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt fit the pattern of the day.  Such is life, use what works and if it doesn‚Äôt fit, adapt and move on.</p>

<p>Through the day I stick my nose into Twitter, get interesting emails which are non-work related or not for now, etc.  Each of these is dealt with in a very similar way, based on the GTD principals of do, diarize, delegate or delete (erm, archive, who deletes stuff really?).  If something is not for me to do but somebody in my team I delegate it in the appropriate way (LH ticket, Skype txt message if urgent) and if needs be give myself a way to remember to follow it up. If a link is interesting for future use I pinboard.in it with a browser plug in.  If it‚Äôs something longer and interesting to read I Push To Kindle it (more on this later).  If it‚Äôs something I want to tweet out at some point but not right now I buffer it.</p>

<p>The game here is to staty work focused, but be able to pivot during the day if something comes up (not just ignore my inbox).  I tend to flick to email and twitter between pomodoros (but not deal with them right there).</p>

<p>By the end of the day it;s time to wrap up.  Each of my team checks in by email (we‚Äôll have touched in several times in the day though) with a simple email - what I did today, as bullet points.  This can be really handy for being able to catch somebody before they go if something is strange/unexpected.</p>

<p>Go west young man</p>

<p>I leave the office, and hopefully my laptop, and walk the 15 minutes of so back to the bus.  If needed this is a good time for catch up calls, sometimes with my boss, sometimes with team members.  If not it‚Äôs a great chance to ring a family member or friend.  I really love time on the phone with friends, it helps to reduce the side effects of living vicariously via Facebook.</p>

<p>Home time is private time, and I‚Äôll answer my phone if it rings, but generally i try not too.  The joy of having multiple jobs means I‚Äôll often work on something else in the evening, but I try not too. Cooking dinner, spending home time and enjoying the couple of hours before bed are important.  I do however zero every inbox at this time, starring the todos (or to re-reads), archiving everything else.  This helps with having a clear head for sleeping ‚Äì I know everything is either unimportant, done or on a todo list.  I also check my calendar as I mentioned before.</p>

<p>Slowing down the brain</p>

<p>When I do head to bed I pick up my Kindle for a few hours.  This is a good time to read through the articles I pushed during the day, or to read something improving (currently Rand‚Äôs Manage Humans) or to slow my brain down with mindless crime fiction.  At the moment I‚Äôm on a 70s sci-fi bent (59p per 25 short stories ‚Äì a bargin).  It‚Äôs time for the alarm soon enough.</p>

<p>Rince and repeat</p>

<p>This might seem like the most ridiculous post on here, but there are lots of little bits of tech that make this possible, from using a smart phone in a smart way, to tools to delay when you need to do things as well at tools which give you the confidence to get on with work.  Without Gmail, Google calendar, Kindle It, Skype, Pinboard, my Kindle, Munin and numerous others, I‚Äôd spend my day bouncing from one thing to another, lost in a sea of uncertainty, and that‚Äôs no good for anybody.</p>
;"ô"<p>A few weeks ago Joel Gascoigne,a chap who I‚Äôve really come to admire since I first ran across him 18 months ago wrote a brilliant blog post about building an excerise habit.  I‚Äôm yet to get regular exercise into my routine (I will, I‚Äôve identified the slot in the day), but it reminded me of a post I wrote years ago about having a daily routine.  Over the intervening years my routine has changed, and I thought it was time to rewrite the post.</p>

<p>I might work on a wide range of things in a day, but my day to day routine is pretty set. and this helps me enormously.</p>

<p>The night before‚Ä¶</p>

<p>My day starts the night before with checking my calendar for tomorrow.  A quick check gives me the heads up about the upcoming day (and week really).  More than once it‚Äôs saved my life, reminding me I need to be in another city, or that something critical has to happen that has slipped my mind.  I know people who put off looking at the diary until the day in question fearing they‚Äôll dwell on it over night, and occasionally this does happen, but rarely.  The more I do it, the better it gets.</p>

<p>The waking dead</p>

<p>My alarm goes off at the same time every day (except weekend), 6:45.  I‚Äôm slowly creeping this time earlier in an effort to find more day.  It‚Äôs in another room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off (or I just fall sleep again).</p>

<p>From turning the alarm off I stagger into the bathroom and (starting last week) stand on my Aria Scales.  I‚Äôve been a FitBitter for nearly a year and find that tracking things reinforces good habits.  Weight myself at the same time, in the same condition (naked and half asleep) every day gives me consistency between my weight and body fat percentage results.</p>

<p>Standing under the shower and attempting to wake up I run though things from the calendar the night before.  Sometimes I can‚Äôt remember anything, which is normally a good sign.</p>

<p>Let the train bus take the strain</p>

<p>I stopped commuting by car at the beginning for the year because of a change of circumstance and thus now commute by bus.  The unexpected consequence of this is that I am more productive, something I didn‚Äôt see coming.  I walk up to the bus stop reading my emails on my phone, it‚Äôs only 5 minutes of walking but this is enough time to scan read everything.  This gives me a heads up on any overnight or unplanned (calendared) work.  It also sets me up for the first call of the day.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm lucky enough to live on the confluence of five bus routes, so it‚Äôs never very long before one comes also.  Having an electronic bus pass that direct debits my account removes the need to always have change on me.  Over the last few years I‚Äôve worked to make my life as hassle free as possible, and getting organised enough to sort out a monthly pass makes all the difference.</p>

"ª!A few weeks ago Joel Gascoigne,a chap who I‚Äôve really come to admire since I first ran across him 18 months ago wrote a brilliant blog post about building an excerise habit.  I‚Äôm yet to get regular exercise into my routine (I will, I‚Äôve identified the slot in the day), but it reminded me of a post I wrote years ago about having a daily routine.  Over the intervening years my routine has changed, and I thought it was time to rewrite the post.

I might work on a wide range of things in a day, but my day to day routine is pretty set. and this helps me enormously.

The night before‚Ä¶

My day starts the night before with checking my calendar for tomorrow.  A quick check gives me the heads up about the upcoming day (and week really).  More than once it‚Äôs saved my life, reminding me I need to be in another city, or that something critical has to happen that has slipped my mind.  I know people who put off looking at the diary until the day in question fearing they‚Äôll dwell on it over night, and occasionally this does happen, but rarely.  The more I do it, the better it gets.

 

The waking dead

My alarm goes off at the same time every day (except weekend), 6:45.  I‚Äôm slowly creeping this time earlier in an effort to find more day.  It‚Äôs in another room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off (or I just fall sleep again).

From turning the alarm off I stagger into the bathroom and (starting last week) stand on my Aria Scales.  I‚Äôve been a FitBitter for nearly a year and find that tracking things reinforces good habits.  Weight myself at the same time, in the same condition (naked and half asleep) every day gives me consistency between my weight and body fat percentage results.

Standing under the shower and attempting to wake up I run though things from the calendar the night before.  Sometimes I can‚Äôt remember anything, which is normally a good sign.

Let the train bus take the strain

I stopped commuting by car at the beginning for the year because of a change of circumstance and thus now commute by bus.  The unexpected consequence of this is that I am more productive, something I didn‚Äôt see coming.  I walk up to the bus stop reading my emails on my phone, it‚Äôs only 5 minutes of walking but this is enough time to scan read everything.  This gives me a heads up on any overnight or unplanned (calendared) work.  It also sets me up for the first call of the day.

I‚Äôm lucky enough to live on the confluence of five bus routes, so it‚Äôs never very long before one comes also.  Having an electronic bus pass that direct debits my account removes the need to always have change on me.  Over the last few years I‚Äôve worked to make my life as hassle free as possible, and getting organised enough to sort out a monthly pass makes all the difference.

Whilst on the bus I ring, or am rang by, The CEO of CANDDi.  It‚Äôs around 7:30 every day, give or take 5 minutes.  We work through the day before, the plans for today, some personal stuff (we‚Äôve known each other for a good few years) and some personal development stuff. It normally goes on until I reach my destination (10 minutes down the line) and beyond.

If I‚Äôve not reached the office by now I normally have a scroll through Twitter about now.

A space to get work done

Once hitting the office I always take the lift up to the top floor.  The rest of the day I‚Äôll use the stairs (a FitBit induced habit) but right now there‚Äôs only one thing on my mind, the first coffee of the day.  I‚Äôve not eaten at this point, and that caffeine hit is the kick start I need.

Setting up the day

Over coffee I get the my laptop fired up.  It lives in the office Mon to Fri (dodgy back habit ‚Äì only carry what you need to), helping to enforce a little bit of home/office separation.  Some day I‚Äôve blog about my homebrew ergonomic setup, but not right now.  This time is used for setting up the day for the people who report to me, so I can get on with work whilst they do.  I spend 15 minutes or so working through the LightHouse tickets raised since I last look, allocating them to a bucket (this week‚Äôs work or ‚Äúto plan‚Äù) and a person (the one who will do the actual work).  Sometimes that even means assigning tickets to myself (Coding! Awesome!)

I then work through my daily tasks, checking the server logs from last night (must find a better way to do this), popping an eye into Munin, etc etc.  It takes time, it rarely shows anything critical, but it‚Äôs extremely reassuring. Once I‚Äôve done it I know that the technology and thus the business, are ok.

Beginning last week we have started having a daily 15 minute scrum meeting on Skype. I‚Äôll see how this goes and blog about it later.

Tomato driven development

Through the day, especially on coding days, I try to work in Pomodoros.  25 minute focused sprints of work, with 5 minutes in between each. Sometimes it works and sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt fit the pattern of the day.  Such is life, use what works and if it doesn‚Äôt fit, adapt and move on.

Through the day I stick my nose into Twitter, get interesting emails which are non-work related or not for now, etc.  Each of these is dealt with in a very similar way, based on the GTD principals of do, diarize, delegate or delete (erm, archive, who deletes stuff really?).  If something is not for me to do but somebody in my team I delegate it in the appropriate way (LH ticket, Skype txt message if urgent) and if needs be give myself a way to remember to follow it up. If a link is interesting for future use I pinboard.in it with a browser plug in.  If it‚Äôs something longer and interesting to read I Push To Kindle it (more on this later).  If it‚Äôs something I want to tweet out at some point but not right now I buffer it.

The game here is to staty work focused, but be able to pivot during the day if something comes up (not just ignore my inbox).  I tend to flick to email and twitter between pomodoros (but not deal with them right there).

By the end of the day it;s time to wrap up.  Each of my team checks in by email (we‚Äôll have touched in several times in the day though) with a simple email - what I did today, as bullet points.  This can be really handy for being able to catch somebody before they go if something is strange/unexpected.

Go west young man

I leave the office, and hopefully my laptop, and walk the 15 minutes of so back to the bus.  If needed this is a good time for catch up calls, sometimes with my boss, sometimes with team members.  If not it‚Äôs a great chance to ring a family member or friend.  I really love time on the phone with friends, it helps to reduce the side effects of living vicariously via Facebook.

Home time is private time, and I‚Äôll answer my phone if it rings, but generally i try not too.  The joy of having multiple jobs means I‚Äôll often work on something else in the evening, but I try not too. Cooking dinner, spending home time and enjoying the couple of hours before bed are important.  I do however zero every inbox at this time, starring the todos (or to re-reads), archiving everything else.  This helps with having a clear head for sleeping ‚Äì I know everything is either unimportant, done or on a todo list.  I also check my calendar as I mentioned before.

Slowing down the brain

When I do head to bed I pick up my Kindle for a few hours.  This is a good time to read through the articles I pushed during the day, or to read something improving (currently Rand‚Äôs Manage Humans) or to slow my brain down with mindless crime fiction.  At the moment I‚Äôm on a 70s sci-fi bent (59p per 25 short stories ‚Äì a bargin).  It‚Äôs time for the alarm soon enough.

Rince and repeat

This might seem like the most ridiculous post on here, but there are lots of little bits of tech that make this possible, from using a smart phone in a smart way, to tools to delay when you need to do things as well at tools which give you the confidence to get on with work.  Without Gmail, Google calendar, Kindle It, Skype, Pinboard, my Kindle, Munin and numerous others, I‚Äôd spend my day bouncing from one thing to another, lost in a sea of uncertainty, and that‚Äôs no good for anybody.;@"/blog/bizpond/{;{

 <p class="created_at">2010-07-14</p>
 <p>Bizpond.co.uk is a simple idea to help less technical businesses find benefit from services such as Twitter and the communities that form around them.</p>

<p>Bizpond went from concept to launch in three months, and was a collaborative project between Stick Theory, Twisted Studios and The Approachable Geek, with suport from PNE Group and Women Into The Network. I was involved to help smooth over the technical project management and to help sort out requirements and technical implementation problems.
Working with Di Gates from Stick Theory I was able to help turn the projects requirements list into a possible list of technologies that could be made use of, and throughout the project I‚Äôve been on hand to translate between techies and other teams. Post launch of Bizpond I‚Äôve been on hand to try and get to the bottom of some fiddly glitches.
One of the aims of Bizpond was to make use of as many external services as possible to minimise the custom code being created. Bolting in external services is never as easy as non-technical people imagine, but it can give great benefits over ‚Äúrolling your own‚Äù. Some of the services that Bizpond is making use of include‚Ä¶
bit.ly : Turns long URLs into short ones suitable for sharing and adds tracking. When Bizpond tweets out a post it includes a shorterned link (for example http://bit.ly/aIeaWo). When this link is clicked it is recorded and the Bizpond team can track this by adding a + to the end of the address http://bit.ly/aIeaWo+</p>

<p>JanRain Engage : Makes integrating the code with Twitter easier for developers, and could be used in the future to allow users to log in using Twitter instead of a custom username and password.
getsatisfaction.com : is used to provide a public viewable feedback mechanism, and only requires a couple of lines of code to be added to the site. Doing your customer support in the public is scary for many, but encourages far better levels of service and customer engagement.
Google Analytics : is used to track not only page views but other key performance indicators. Adding Analytics to a website is trivial, but without some additional configuration and code it will not necessarily track the things that you need it to. Bizpond needed to know how many of it‚Äôs notices with being replied to, and how many were being shared, both of which would not have been tracked by default. The Approachable Geek was able to match business requirements to code hooks, as well as deliver the on site training for the administrator on how to extract the gems from the wealth of info that GA provides.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve just finished a short project with a Newcastle Upon Tyne based estate agent, helping to smooth over some of their accounting and records processes.

All the following calculations are derived from this data, mostly using the extremely powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table">Pivot Table</a> (and a few extra functions).</p>

<p>Pivot Tables make it easy to take a stack of tabular data and to group and filter specific columns based on the values of other columns. It‚Äôs uses are endless from summarising sales data to digging out nuggets of insight which are buried in the morass of information.</p>

 <p>Yes, the title is a little bit silly, but it‚Äôs been a fun year so I thought it was time to reflect a little.</p>

<p>2011 started with me taking a few months out from The Approachable Geek to form and built a new company.  Over the first 4 months of the year <a href="James Rutherford">weddingtales.co.uk</a> was born, shaped, coded and launched along with <a href="http://www.creativenucleus.com/">James Rutherford</a> though <a href="http://vimeo.com/differenceengin">The Difference Engine</a>.  By the end of 2011 we‚Äôve handled over 1,500 wedding guests and nearly 10,000 wedding photos.</p>

<p>Whilst building <a href="http://weddingtales.co.uk/">weddingtales.co.uk</a> I did a few consulting jobs, mostly data thrashing including preparation for a huge Sage data import (155,000 product records needed cleaning before they got into the system)  and some quick and dirty Excel data jobs too.</p>

<p>In March I had one of my most challenging yet rewarding jobs of the year delivering a one day course for 12 to 17 years olds getting them up and running with Arduino circuit boards (and vibrobots).  A really tough day (for me) but one of the most satisfying.</p>

<p>The early summer saw some more Excel jobs, including reducing the hours a local estate agency spent matching payments to tenants by as much as 15 hours a week by building a smarter and more automated spreadsheet.  I also helped deliver the Blog It! masters course for Newcastle University, learning a lot about the common problems non-techies face with using domestic IT kit along the way.</p>

<p>Late summer though to the end of the year has had be focussing on two main projects, one writing complex data-capture scripts and social data storage mechanisms and the other being my most challenging project to day ‚Äì running the Design It Built It conference.  More on that another time,</p>

<p>2012 is virtually upon me and as I type this I‚Äôm booked up until April which is a pleasant situation to be in.  DIBI is going to take up a lot of time, as is a new longer running project, but more news on that another time.</p>

 <p>Yes, the title is a little bit silly, but it‚Äôs been a fun year so I thought it was time to reflect a little.</p>

<p>2011 started with me taking a few months out from The Approachable Geek to form and built a new company.  Over the first 4 months of the year <a href="James Rutherford">weddingtales.co.uk</a> was born, shaped, coded and launched along with <a href="http://www.creativenucleus.com/">James Rutherford</a> though <a href="http://vimeo.com/differenceengin">The Difference Engine</a>.  By the end of 2011 we‚Äôve handled over 1,500 wedding guests and nearly 10,000 wedding photos.</p>

<p>Whilst building <a href="http://weddingtales.co.uk/">weddingtales.co.uk</a> I did a few consulting jobs, mostly data thrashing including preparation for a huge Sage data import (155,000 product records needed cleaning before they got into the system)  and some quick and dirty Excel data jobs too.</p>

<p>In March I had one of my most challenging yet rewarding jobs of the year delivering a one day course for 12 to 17 years olds getting them up and running with Arduino circuit boards (and vibrobots).  A really tough day (for me) but one of the most satisfying.</p>

<p>The early summer saw some more Excel jobs, including reducing the hours a local estate agency spent matching payments to tenants by as much as 15 hours a week by building a smarter and more automated spreadsheet.  I also helped deliver the Blog It! masters course for Newcastle University, learning a lot about the common problems non-techies face with using domestic IT kit along the way.</p>

<p>Late summer though to the end of the year has had be focussing on two main projects, one writing complex data-capture scripts and social data storage mechanisms and the other being my most challenging project to day ‚Äì running the Design It Built It conference.  More on that another time,</p>

<p>2012 is virtually upon me and as I type this I‚Äôm booked up until April which is a pleasant situation to be in.  DIBI is going to take up a lot of time, as is a new longer running project, but more news on that another time.</p>

 <p class="created_at">2011-05-10</p>
 <p>Hack Days, like BarCamps before them, are a phenomenon that went through the geeky community like a dose of salts, and have then worked their way sideways into other communities. A hack day involves getting a bunch of people (coders, designers, ideas people, subject matter experts) together for a 24hour+ session, where they make things. Very often hack days will be themed around a subject, often related to their hosts. The hosts are often making a range of data or services available for people to built things with.</p>

<p>What comes out of the room when you give geeks data and some time to play with it (also with food and coffee) is frankly amazing.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be awarded a travel bursar for Culture Hack Scotland last week, and so headed up to Edinburgh on Friday afternoon to bash out something (at that point unknown) using the amazing data sets that had been provided.</p>

<p>After a bunch of welcome talks and a few glasses of white wine, we got down to bashing ideas around and coding. I really wanted to work with the footfall data provided by City of Edinburgh Council. It has the number of people to pass 19 spots around the city for the last 365 days, in the form of Excel.</p>

<p>Lots of the data provided was historical (2010‚Ä≤s Festival data for example) because the 2011 data is not ready yet, however it‚Äôs all in the same format, so hopefully anything built on top of the 2010 data could be adapted to run in 2011.</p>

<p>When I started working with the footfall data it became apparent that whilst it was clean and neat (unlike a lot of publically available data) it was not very useful in a spreadsheet. What would have been lovely was a queryable API, where you can ask for the data for a given day, or venue, or day and venue, and get back a set of numbers. This was what I decided to built. It wasn‚Äôt going to be pretty or shiny like some of the works of art, but it would turn out to be very useful.</p>

<p>So, by Sunday morning, it was live. http://edinburghfootfall.theapproachablegeek.co.uk/ provides a set of end points which return nice clean JSON data. JSON seems to be the data type of choice for most web apps and API mashups these days, and it‚Äôs lovely to code with. Over the next few weeks I‚Äôll update the API to add in some more filtering and hopefully keep it live for as long as it‚Äôs useful.</p>

<p>There were lots of amazing hacks produced over the course of the weekend, and I was blown away not just by the quantity but also the quality. 24 hours really is a long time at times.</p>

<p>Edit (6/6/2010) Some of the hack (including one based on the data I made available) made it into the Guardian Data Blog!</p>

 <p class="created_at">2011-05-21</p>
 <p>I fell in love with timelapse films as a child. There really is something magic about watching plants growing in front of your eyes, or seeing landscapes grow and evolve right in front of you. Creating timelapse films used to be the preserve of the professionals with hugely expensive kit, but no longer.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been making use of an amazing open source project called Canon Hardware Development Kit I‚Äôve been producing timelapse films for the last couple of months. CHDK is installed to a memorycard and replaces the normal software on a range of cheap Canon cameras, unlocking a range of features that are (at best) only available on the top of the range Canon kit, or completely new.</p>

<p>Installing CHDK is a touch fiddly, but the instructions are pretty good and if you‚Äôre using Windows or Mac there are installer such as cardtricks which simply the process.</p>

<p>CHDK does not run on all cameras, not even all Canon cameras, so check the website carefully before spending money. I have had success with a Canon A480 from Argos (which was on offer). You will also need an external powersupply which are fearsomely expensive from Canon, however an unofficial one from Ebay was only ¬£15.</p>

<p>CHDKs biggest feature is that you can write scripts for the camera, and it will automatically process. In this case I got a timelapse script which takes a picture every minute and saves it. Using a nice large memorycard (4GB) you have plenty of space for thousands of photos.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had my camera installed in a range of great locations in the North East for the last month, mostly thanks to friends securing me access to places I‚Äôd never have got into without them. Installations are mostly in the MacGyver style, using plastic bags and ductape to make everything waterproof and less likely to blow away.</p>

<p>Once you get the photos back it‚Äôs just a matter of compiling them down into a film, for which there are lots of options. I‚Äôm using mencoder, which is a bit fiddly but has lots of options.</p>

<p>Finally, the films go up to my video hoster of choice, Vimeo.</p>

CHDKs biggest feature is that you can write scripts for the camera, and it will automatically process. In this case I got a timelapse script which takes a picture every minute and saves it. Using a nice large memorycard (4GB) you have plenty of space for thousands of photos.

I‚Äôve had my camera installed in a range of great locations in the North East for the last month, mostly thanks to friends securing me access to places I‚Äôd never have got into without them. Installations are mostly in the MacGyver style, using plastic bags and ductape to make everything waterproof and less likely to blow away.

Once you get the photos back it‚Äôs just a matter of compiling them down into a film, for which there are lots of options. I‚Äôm using mencoder, which is a bit fiddly but has lots of options.

Finally, the films go up to my video hoster of choice, Vimeo.;@≥"/blog/twits/{;{

<p>When you‚Äôre not used to using online services regularly and you‚Äôre faced with the front page of Twitter for example, it‚Äôs reasonably intimidating and there aren‚Äôt a lot of people to help you get started.

<p>So, WIN‚Äôs sessions are there as safe space, at a pace dictated by the group (hopefully), with nibbles and wine too.

 <p class="created_at">2010-06-2</p>
 <p>A client has over 1000 Excel spreadsheets that had been exported from a booking system that the dreaded tax man required.  They had come out of the system in incrementing numbers 0001.xls, 0002.xls etc, one for each day of the previous 3 years of trading.</p>

<p>The taxman however  requested that they be named with the date they represented 23-06-2010.xls for example, and if my client couldn‚Äôt provide them in that format they‚Äôd be charged for the manual labour of the tax people renaming them.  So they set about opening up each one, finding  the cell that corresponded to the date, closing the spreadsheet, renaming the file, and then moving on to the next one.  In total it took 30 seconds once you were practiced per sheet.</p>

<p>1000 sheets x 30 seconds = 8 hours and 20 minutes, and given the repetitiveness of the task, a likely candidate for manual errors.</p>

<p>This seemed horrendously wasteful to me, so they gave me all the spreadsheets on a USB memory stick, and an hour later I handed it back with all of the sheets renamed correctly for the taxman.  I wrote a small piece of script to open each sheet, select out the right row, and rename the file.  It took 50 minutes to develop and 2 minutes to run.</p>

Annoyingly they are sort of right too, but what they don‚Äôt give credit to is that all of these things can be really intimidating for people who don‚Äôt live their entire lives online.  That‚Äôs where I come in, to provide a guidance, a bit of non-patronising hand holding, and some practical help if people are stuck.  I don‚Äôt pretend to have all the answers, and in many cases there is no one right way to do it (though there are often lots of examples of how not to do it).  I‚Äôm there to facilitate, not dictate.</p>

<p>Being no writer I was handling the ‚Äútech side‚Äù of blogging, from getting started on Blogger.com, wordpress.com (and a few others), though RSS, linking, embedding media, building an audience, blogging for business and finally a little about SEO and monetization. Being a writer Judith was working with students to improve their content, writing style and other such things.</p>

I‚Äôve also got a lot better at helping to demystify some of the complexities of this internet thing too I hope.</p>

Little insights into the world of Estate Living have been really interesting (and I love ‚Äúthe view from the farm‚Äù snippet written in the persona of an animal in each one). I‚Äôm also hopeful that Musician Verses Student blossoms into an awesome online juxtaposition of lifestyles.</p>

Practical things aside, I‚Äôve been amazed at the posts that my class have produced. I really enjoyed the first few posts from The Reluctant Buddhist, who sadly didn‚Äôt write a huge amount more. A post about self harming on the Antics Of A Brittle Asthmatic is a truly seductive and moving piece of writing. Little insights into the world of Estate Living have been really interesting (and I love ‚Äúthe view from the farm‚Äù snippet written in the persona of an animal in each one). I‚Äôm also hopeful that Musician Verses Student blossoms into an awesome online juxtaposition of lifestyles.

All of the students who stuck with the course right through produced work I was proud of, and I hope that they‚Äôve found a sense of self confidence and assurity that means they will carry on blogging, either in their current guises or in new projects.;@‘"/styles/stylesheet/{;{	;"–<ul>

 <p class="created_at">2011-08-26</p>
 <p>Recently I‚Äôve been doing quite a bit of work turning packs of HTML and CSS into <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> themes.  Shopify is an amazing ‚ÄúShop as a Service‚Äù website which makes it really easy to get your online shop up and running quickly letting Shopify handle all the hard bits (scaling, the CMS, payments etc).</p>

<p>What makes Shopify really impressive is you can write (or buy) themes for your shop which are extreamly customisable.  The functional logical of the templates if written in a language called Liquid.  At first <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> looks clunky but it‚Äôs actually very powerful when used in combination with Shopify‚Äôs available data.</p>

<p>Shopify also let you add into the theme any other assets you might need, css, images, JavaScript etc. and this lead me to a frustrating problem which it seems worth writing up.  Looking back it‚Äôs screamingly obvious, but at the time it was far from it.</p>

<p>I was trying add a <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">lightbox</a> to a product, a simple enough problem normally.  Because the site was already using jquery I chose a jquery based <a href="http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/">lightbox</a> rather than introduce yet another set of JS libraries.  I added the JS files, the css and the image assets to the theme, bolted on the right selectors etc and it was up and running.  Clicking on the thumbnail caused a nice big image to be overlaid.</p>

<p>The problem was that the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose‚Äù buttons had broken images.  When you upload assets to Shopify it has no support for sub-directories in the assets directory so the paths of ‚Äú../images/close_label.gif‚Äù needed modifying.  I tried ‚Äúclose_label.gif‚Äù, but that failed too, with the generated path being that of the page we were on, not the location of the JS file.  Very frustrating.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The problem was that I needed to get Liquid to render that image path so that it would take on the location as specified by Shopify.  JS assets however, unlike .liquid files, are not parsed, and so the {{ ‚Äòclose_label.gif‚Äô</td>
      <td>asset_url }} tag is never replaced.  I tried every dirty hack i could think of but nothing worked.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Finally, after swapping out jquery-lightbox for slimbox it worked !  Why?  Because <a href="http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2">Slimbox</a> uses CSS properly to style to pop-over rather than having the JS write the images into the DOM.  Proper separation of display and content wins the day.  CSS taken on the relative paths to the images based on it‚Äôs location, rather than the location of the page as the JS method caused.</p>

<p>The moral of the story, separation of presentation and content is important.</p>

Recently I‚Äôve been doing quite a bit of work turning packs of HTML and CSS into [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) themes.  Shopify is an amazing ‚ÄúShop as a Service‚Äù website which makes it really easy to get your online shop up and running quickly letting Shopify handle all the hard bits (scaling, the CMS, payments etc).

What makes Shopify really impressive is you can write (or buy) themes for your shop which are extreamly customisable.  The functional logical of the templates if written in a language called Liquid.  At first [Liquid](http://www.liquidmarkup.org/) looks clunky but it‚Äôs actually very powerful when used in combination with Shopify‚Äôs available data.

Shopify also let you add into the theme any other assets you might need, css, images, JavaScript etc. and this lead me to a frustrating problem which it seems worth writing up.  Looking back it‚Äôs screamingly obvious, but at the time it was far from it.

I was trying add a [lightbox](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) to a product, a simple enough problem normally.  Because the site was already using jquery I chose a jquery based [lightbox](http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/) rather than introduce yet another set of JS libraries.  I added the JS files, the css and the image assets to the theme, bolted on the right selectors etc and it was up and running.  Clicking on the thumbnail caused a nice big image to be overlaid.

The problem was that the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose‚Äù buttons had broken images.

The problem was that I needed to get Liquid to render that image path so that it would take on the location as specified by Shopify.  JS assets however, unlike .liquid files, are not parsed, and so the {{ ‚Äòclose_label.gif‚Äô | asset_url }} tag is never replaced.  I tried every dirty hack i could think of but nothing worked.

;"<h1><a href="/blog/online-services/">Using online services to help run your business</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-09-17</p>
 <p>Here at The Approachable Geek I‚Äôve been making use of a whole bunch of online services to get up and running. Not all of these are appropriate to every business, but they might well be helpful to you too. The good news is that many of these ‚ÄúSoftware As A Service‚Äù bits of kit are as functional and usable as their installed counterparts. Gone are the days of needing to be a hardcore geek to get going, and if you need a bit of help along the way there as lots of people out there using them (and you can always give me a ring).</p>

<p><a href="http://fre.ag/375peo89">FreeAgent</a> is a great online tool for tracking time, expenses and invoicing. It lets me keep track of all of my time spent and out-of-pocket expenses, and to generate client invoices with these added to them if I like. The dashboard gives me a quick view on who I have to chase because they‚Äôre running late paying me, and what my current (estimated) tax liability is (roughly, you‚Äôre still going to need an accountant). I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of FreeAgent, it keep‚Äôs an eejit like me straight with time and money.</p>

<p>Google Apps for Domains unlocks the power of Google Apps (email, spreadsheets, documents and calendaring), all based on your own domain names, configurable to be accessible to only your staff. There are multiple options available but the two of most use are likely to be, <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Standard Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">For Business</a>. For Business is paid for and offers more services, probably most importantly for most businesses, the ability to import from your existing systems (Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Notes etc).
I‚Äôm currently using Google Apps for Domains to provide my email (sending and receiving from theapproachablegeek.co.uk), calendaring (including syncing to my HTC Desire phone) and for handling documentation (including pesky Microsoft Word documents).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTczMDY2MjU5">Dropbox</a> is what happens when technology evolves to a point where very complex things suddenly become accessible to the rest of us. Dropbox provides the equivalent of shared disk drive, but instead of being stored on a server somewhere in your office it is provided by Dropbox online. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be online to access it, the files are stored locally on your computer, and syncronised online. The neat trick about Dropbox is that you can install it to multiple computers, and they stay in sync. Your files are also available online through the Dropbox website. No messing about with USB keyrings, external hard drives and complex homebrew backup solutions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> is a substitute for Microsoft Office. Open Office is free, and very interoperable with MS Office. You need to be careful when you save files if you‚Äôre sending them to people using MS Office, but for 99% of the time it causes me very few problems. With the cost of a full version of MS Office close to ¬£350 for a single business license, Open Office provides a very affordable options for those of us who only need to work with simple documents.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> is a very usable flavour of the open source operating system Linux. I use Ubuntu on all three of my computers (laptop, desktop and servers). I no long use Windows or Apple software, which was a big step for me, but the conversion has been reasonably smooth.</p>

<p>There are a hundred other pieces of software that are free (and mostly open source) that I also use day to day, but I‚Äôll save these for another time.</p>

<p>I should point out that if you use the links I provided for Dropbox and FreeAgent then we will both benefit, as both provide referral discounts. In the case of Dropbox you will get an extra 500mb of space, and FreeAgent will come with a 10% discount.</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/online-services/">Using online services to help run your business</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-09-17</p>
 <p>Here at The Approachable Geek I‚Äôve been making use of a whole bunch of online services to get up and running. Not all of these are appropriate to every business, but they might well be helpful to you too. The good news is that many of these ‚ÄúSoftware As A Service‚Äù bits of kit are as functional and usable as their installed counterparts. Gone are the days of needing to be a hardcore geek to get going, and if you need a bit of help along the way there as lots of people out there using them (and you can always give me a ring).</p>

<p><a href="http://fre.ag/375peo89">FreeAgent</a> is a great online tool for tracking time, expenses and invoicing. It lets me keep track of all of my time spent and out-of-pocket expenses, and to generate client invoices with these added to them if I like. The dashboard gives me a quick view on who I have to chase because they‚Äôre running late paying me, and what my current (estimated) tax liability is (roughly, you‚Äôre still going to need an accountant). I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of FreeAgent, it keep‚Äôs an eejit like me straight with time and money.</p>

<p>Google Apps for Domains unlocks the power of Google Apps (email, spreadsheets, documents and calendaring), all based on your own domain names, configurable to be accessible to only your staff. There are multiple options available but the two of most use are likely to be, <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Standard Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">For Business</a>. For Business is paid for and offers more services, probably most importantly for most businesses, the ability to import from your existing systems (Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Notes etc).
I‚Äôm currently using Google Apps for Domains to provide my email (sending and receiving from theapproachablegeek.co.uk), calendaring (including syncing to my HTC Desire phone) and for handling documentation (including pesky Microsoft Word documents).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTczMDY2MjU5">Dropbox</a> is what happens when technology evolves to a point where very complex things suddenly become accessible to the rest of us. Dropbox provides the equivalent of shared disk drive, but instead of being stored on a server somewhere in your office it is provided by Dropbox online. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be online to access it, the files are stored locally on your computer, and syncronised online. The neat trick about Dropbox is that you can install it to multiple computers, and they stay in sync. Your files are also available online through the Dropbox website. No messing about with USB keyrings, external hard drives and complex homebrew backup solutions.</p>

I‚Äôm currently using Google Apps for Domains to provide my email (sending and receiving from theapproachablegeek.co.uk), calendaring (including syncing to my HTC Desire phone) and for handling documentation (including pesky Microsoft Word documents).

[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTczMDY2MjU5) is what happens when technology evolves to a point where very complex things suddenly become accessible to the rest of us. Dropbox provides the equivalent of shared disk drive, but instead of being stored on a server somewhere in your office it is provided by Dropbox online.

 <p class="created_at">2012-08-07</p>
 <p>A lot of people I know (mostly of a certain generation) still hesitate before buying online and often not because of fears of online security but customer service. ‚ÄúWhat do I di if it‚Äôs broken? How do I take it back to the shop?‚Äù are valid questions.</p>

<p>Some companies get this very wrong (Ebuyer, I am looking at you here) but just recently two suppliers have got it complete right.</p>

<p>I lost my Fitbit whilst helping clear out the house of a deceased relative. It was on the other side of the country, and on a very stressful day, it‚Äô probably got pinged off my trouser pocket whilst I was dragging a sofa round or something similar. I tweeted about how sad I was when I noticed that evening.</p>

<p>Fitbit‚Äôs UK team noticed and replied, suggesting I get in touch with their US support team. I dropped them a slightly confused email and a week later a brand new FitBit, exactly the same as the one I‚Äôd lost, came through my door. Amazing.</p>

<p>Last night I got home to my favorite surprise of the month, my Larder Box. Larder Box is a subscription service who send you tasty treats every month. It‚Äôs an offshoot of Love Your Larder, a local start up. Sadly my Larder Box had not travelled well (I blame the delivery company here) and as a result the box was crushed on one side and the lid had come off the Bacon Jam resulting in a sticky mess. I dropped an email to Larder Box just to let them know (they should know if their delivery company has screwed up right?) and got a reply within minutes from the founder asking for a photo and saying a replacement box would be on it‚Äôs way to me asap.</p>

<p>Customer service isn‚Äôt lacking online, it‚Äôs thriving, and technologies such as Twitter, Uservoice, CustomerSure and plain old email are really helping to nail it. I can‚Äôt think of a shop who would have done what FitBit did for example.</p>

"MIf you think I might be able to help, get in touch and lets chat about it, I‚Äôm always open to new things, however these are my core skills if you will.

Backend development
---------------------

The front end of a website is the bit you see, and it‚Äôs probably written in a combination of language namely HTML and CSS.  I know my way round both, but I‚Äôm no designer.

The backend of a website is the code and databases which make it work and spit out HTML+CSS for your browser to consume.  This is wehere I am most happy.  I‚Äôm a PHP developer primarily working with CodeIgniter.  I also use things like Python and shell scripting to crunch data.

Put development infrastructure and processes in place
---------------------

If you‚Äôre building an online business or writing software there are things you should have in place from the outset including configuration management, database backups, deployment mechanisms and monitoring of resources.  I‚Äôve been involved in several start-up businesses and have helped get them get and running smoothly.

Automation of data processessing
---------------------

I‚Äôve saved companies hundred of man hours of manual entry and ‚Äúby eye‚Äù correction using a wide and varied toolbox (normally involving some text manipulation tools, Excel and a shed load of text files).  If you‚Äôve got a database you need to get data in or out of, or a mountain of information in a difficult format, I can probably help.

Working on why your website doesn‚Äôt work
---------------------

If you‚Äôve got a site up and running, and nobody is visiting (or worse still you don‚Äôt know who or how many people are visiting), I can help.  I‚Äôm not an SEO consultant (but I know my way round), and I‚Äôm not a Social Media consultant (but I have been running blogs for 10 years).  I do understand how to build successful sites however.;@¸"/blog/{;{	;"’

 <p class="created_at">2011-01-06</p>
 <p>For a few years I‚Äôve been interested in reducing my environmental footprint, and the footprint of my business. Working from home this naturally means reducing the amount of energy my home is using. The first step on this road is measuring how much energy you use, and to a certain extent being aware of how much energy you‚Äôre using will lead to you reducing the amount.</p>

<p>To this end I bought a Wattson a few years ago, a really beautiful energy monitor. It comes in two pieces, a transmitter which clips to your power cable near the meter, and the readout.</p>

<p>As well as giving you a numerical readout of your energy usage it gently glows to rate your current usage from blue (low) to red (high). It‚Äôs an astoundingly compelling piece of kit, more expensive that other energy monitors, but one you‚Äôd happily have in your living room (and thus actually look at).</p>

<p>I‚Äôve wanted to record my energy usage, display it online and track it, since I got the wattson, but it‚Äôs not quite as easy as I hoped. The Wattson does record the data, but to get it off you have to plug it in by USB and then use a Flash application to download it. Whilst plugged in the Wattson is not recording (which is annoying) and the software doesn‚Äôt work well on my computers.</p>

<p>Ideally I wanted to leave the Wattson plugged into my home server all the time, recording and posting the info online, and it turned out a few little hacks made this possible.</p>

<p>The rather beautiful Wattson readout unit
Firstly, I‚Äôve got a rather old Wattson and thus the transmitter is battery powered, which is not ideal.  The new transmitters can be mains powered, but with a little soldiering my Wattson transmitter is now mains powered, making use of an old Nokia power transformer to replace the 4 AA batteries. It‚Äôs not a pretty hack, but it was simple and functional.</p>

<p>Secondly my Wattson is now permenently connected to a computer. I have a little Linux powered laptop that serves up data to the house (including my webcam on the bird feeders) which is turned on all the time. It‚Äôs an old Toscheba I got for free and is running Ubuntu linux.</p>

<p>Connecting the Wattson via a USB cable, I can get data off it via a little utility that‚Äôs been developed independently of DIY Kyoto (who make the Wattson) called openwattson. With a little bit of scripting my server now pulls the current energy rating off the Wattson, adds it to a log file for the day, and pushes it online.</p>

<p>This means that for every day I get a text file with an entry for every minute with the amount of energy I‚Äôm using. With a little bit of PHP scripting and Google Charts this can then be turned into a neat little graph for each day, like the one below. The current live data page is online now</p>
