The Approachable Geek
---------------------

I’m Oli Wood and I'm a consultant and coder available for hire, primarily working in PHP and Javascript.  I've been working with technology since 1998 and have worked on projects ranging from two man bootstrapped start-ups to multi-million pound government projects.

I helped curate and compare Design It Build It [2010](http://lanyrd.com/2010/dibi/) and [2011](http://lanyrd.com/2011/dibi/) and was the overall curator of [DIBI 2012](http://lanyrd.com/2012/dibi/).

I started working in the digital world building websites for a glass firm in the late 90’s, you can find my employment history and hopefully a few nice words about me, on my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/oliwood).

Outside of work can normally be found listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen.
