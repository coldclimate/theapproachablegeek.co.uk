I’m Oli Wood and I'm a consultant and coder available for hire, primarily involved in version control, deployment, infrastructure and operations.  I've been working for technology firms since 1998 and have worked on projects ranging from two man bootstrapped start-ups to multi-million pound government projects.


I started working in the digital world building websites for a glass firm in the late 90’s, you can find my employment history and hopefully a few nice words about me, on my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/oliwood).

Outside of work can normally be found listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen or attempting to grow apples and soft fruit<a href="http://www.theapproachablegeek.co.uk/_assets/images/happy-birthday-lori-pig.jpg">.</a>
