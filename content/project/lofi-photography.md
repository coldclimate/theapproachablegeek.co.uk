### A work in progress

I'll update this more another day.

I love messing about with cameras, mostly digital.  This page gathers together some of my experiments.  Some of them might get their own pages eventually.


### Early timelapse experiments

After I bought my first digital camera (A Fuji S500 I think) I spent ages glueing together [gPhoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/) to try and take timelape photos using a laptop + cron + a long USB cable.  I think I also used a cheap webcam at some point which is how I ended up timelapsing a racist novel being turned into mushrooms

Eventually I bought a camera especially for making timelapses, as documented on TODO link, and most of the results are early videos on up on my [Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/user4123311)

### Solarcans

I've been messing around for a few years with [Solarcans](https://solarcan.co.uk/) and they are excellent and fun things.  I've handrolled a few too, with thanks to Sam at Solarcans, reusing various tins and cans.


### Mustard tin

The hole was too big.

### Redbull can with 3 holes

Multiple exposures are fun

### Azera coffee tin

Lots of water ingress.  I don't understand why there's not a clear trail here.
