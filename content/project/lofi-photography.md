## A work in progress

I'll update this more another day.

I love messing about with cameras, mostly digital.  This page gathers together some of my experiments.  Some of them might get their own pages eventually.


## Early timelapse experiments

After I bought my first digital camera (A Fuji S500 I think) I spent ages glueing together [gPhoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/) to try and take timelape photos using a laptop + cron + a long USB cable.  I think I also used a cheap webcam at some point which is how I ended up timelapsing a racist novel being turned into mushrooms

Eventually I bought a camera especially for making timelapses, as documented on TODO link, and most of the results are early videos on up on my [Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/user4123311)

## Solarcans

I've been messing around for a few years with [Solarcans](https://solarcan.co.uk/) and they are excellent and fun things.  I've handrolled a few too, with thanks to Sam at Solarcans, reusing various tins and cans.



### My original can

A birthday present from a good friend.  The tree is sadly no longer there.  The can came free and ended up rolling around in the garden for a few week, leading to some water ingress.

### Lockdown can

I left a can attached to a tree for 16 months, from January 2020 until April 2021 (thanks lockdown!).  It must have slipped at some point, leading to the gap in the arcs.

### Mustard tin

The hole was too big.

### Mustard tin Take Two

I loaded and remounted the Colman's tin and left it for a couple of months.  It turns out I'd put the paper in back to front!  Luckily, a little water damage and light leakage meant it was partially exposed and some auto-lvelling in GIMP lead to this rather pleasant result.

### Redbull can with 3 holes

Multiple exposures are fun

### Azera coffee tin

Lots of water ingress.  I don't understand why there's not a clear trail here.

## Sun Prints

I was given some photo sensetive paper which is exposed in about 15 minutes in bright sunlight.  I've experimented with occluding the sun (with plants) and focusing the sun with a big chunk of glass.
