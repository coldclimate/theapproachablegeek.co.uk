I’m Oli Wood (and as I write this, I’m 31) and I run The Approachable Geek.  I’m keenly involved in the North East tech scene, and in the last year have spoken at [Super Mondays](http://www.supermondays.org/) events and helped curate and compare Design It Build It [2010](http://lanyrd.com/2010/dibi/) and [2011](http://lanyrd.com/2011/dibi/) and then ran all of [2012](http://lanyrd.com/2012/dibi/).

Before setting out on my own I spent 2 years at The BGroup in Newcastle heading up all of the digital side of the agency and before working for bgroup I worked at Accenture for three years on several large projects.

Prior to gainful employment I spent four years at Durham University leaving with a Masters in Computer Science and a trail of websites and involvement with my college.

Before university I built websites for a glass company in the late 90’s, you can find my employment history and hopefully a few nice words about me, on my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/oliwood).

I was born and raised in Cumbria, and outside of work can normally be found listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen.
