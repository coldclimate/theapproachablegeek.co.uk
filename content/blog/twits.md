title: Twitter for Twits

The very excellent Women Into The Network are running a series of events over the next few months in the North East which are a gentle introduction to social networks, social media and finding your feet online, and I’m presenting some of them.

As a fully fledged geek, and one who mostly does business with other reasonably technical people most of the time it’s easy to forget that so many of the technologies that I use day to day are completely new and pretty scary for a lot fo people.

When you’re not used to using online services regularly and you’re faced with the front page of Twitter for example, it’s reasonably intimidating and there aren’t a lot of people to help you get started.  There are loads of articles about tools, strategy and “making Twitter work for your business”, but getting started, thats not as easy as lots of people make out.

So, WIN’s sessions are there as safe space, at a pace dictated by the group (hopefully), with nibbles and wine too.  At the end of the three sessions I’ll post a link to the slides deck (if you’d like it in the meantime drop me an email or give me a ring), but until then, all of the links to tools that I talked about can be found here on delicious (another interesting online tool that might be of interest to you too).
