I've never got round to writing weeknotes despite seeing lots of people I admire and who's advice I trust writing them until this week, when I saw a diagram of the likely weeks in my life.  So few boxes, so little time.  As well as trying to Do More Stuff with my time I thought it would be a good idea to Write Stuff Down and this is my first shot.  I'll try and keep this work related, with the odd venture into my social life.
