I mentioned my #TODO list in a previous post.  It's nothing complex, but chewing on it late last night, I thought it might be worth writing up.  Late night was followed by early morning, so here I am.

I've started both previous "how I work and live" posts being embarrassed to be writing them, because they're not especially clever or new, but I've had some lovely feedback and so maybe they're at least entertained, if not helped, some folks.

Over the last 26 years, what I work on and how has evolved significantly, mostly because at 14 I was washing dishes in a pub and today I'm architecting clouds (or something ridiculous sounding), but the processes behind "what do I work on now" have fallen into a few small groups.

# Dirty plates and Scarab tickets

My first job was washing dishes in a pub in Cumbria, at a time when it was going gangbusters.  The answer to "what do I do next" was easy, the next thing was in a big stinky heap behind you and needed washing up.  Crockery and cutlry from the dining room came in, got scraped into "the shit box" and piled onto a trolley.  Pans, trays and knives from the chefs went onto the same trolley.

The job was basically to keep taking stuff off the trolley, washing it and putting it onto the top of the chest freezer and then when you got a chance, putting stuff away.  You had to choose what to wash up next, either for efficiency (do big stacks of plates together, it's easier), or to keep the system flowing (wash up huge pans because they're quick to do but take up a lot of space on the trolley) or because of external priorities (chefs yelling because they need a big pan [RIGHT FUCKING NOW](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kitchen-Confidential-Anthony-Bourdain-ebook/dp/B004U9J9GS?crid=1U5T0UABRURL2&dchild=1&keywords=kitchen+confidential&qid=1625034754&sprefix=kitchen+conf%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=97d7c619ece64cf8ca6f8abc579458c4&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)).

Every so often weird stuff would come up, duck roasting trays need soaking in boiling water to clean them, the shit box needs emptying into the outside bins immediately, a very heavy thing needs carrying in and one time all the kitchen staff piled out armed with whatever came to hand because a waitresses boyfriend turned up and started causing a fuss.  The answer of what to do next was easy, it was right in front of you and it was pretty satisfying at the end of a long night to close the door on a kitchen where everything was put away, every surface wiped, the floor mopped and the sinks washed out, even if it paid nothing and your hands were ruined from 8 hours submerged in water.

The more I think on it, the more this manner of working carried over into my first IT job when 7 or so years later I worked on a version control and deployment team (yes, that was a thing) on a large government project whilst working for a consultancy.   As a very junior employee doing very hands on technical work, my work was driven by a ticketing system, called Scarab (which looked a lot like [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) now I think about it).  The job was basically picking which Scarab to do next, assigning it, then working it until it was done or blocked.  We chose which Scarab to pick, either because it was chronologically next, or other Scarabs had dependencies on it, or somebody was yelling at us for it (literally in some cases, I will never forget you Ruby).  Delivering complex Oracle 9i+Solaris tickets turned out to be pretty much like washing dishes, only it paid more, and you never got back to the clean kitchen.

It was whilst working at that company I lived with somebody who first got me thinking about how I worked.  In passing, they mentioned GTD, [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) which I didn't really get.  I was cynical, not helped by watching them once write "pick up socks" in a notepad whist looking at a pair of balled up socks on their bedroom floor, but I did eventually years later pick up a cheap copy of the book and read it.
