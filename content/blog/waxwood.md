title: A quick look at the tools for raising charity donations
---

Every few years I try and raise some money for a good cause and this year I decided to make that (St Mary's Hospice)[http://www.stmaryshospice.org.uk/] for the second time.  Unlike my lake swim last time I went for something a bit less dangerous but a whole lot more personal, shaving my head and waxing all the hair off my body.  To try and make as much cash as I could I used a few digital tools along the way.

Bits of this might sound mercenary but please don't read them that way, to raise the maximum amount for the charity I decided to double down on my promotion efforts.

## Kicking it off

First thing was to get a Just Giving page up with a suitably linkbait title [Back, sack, crack and beyond!](https://www.justgiving.com/back-sack-crack-plus) with the story of why I'm raising money and a picture that was safe for sharing but showed my hairiness.  

Second thing was to create a short URL for this [http://bit.ly/waxwood](http://bit.ly/waxwood).  I actually had to do this because when I tried to paste a link into our companies internal social network the word "crack" was not allowed (ho hum).  However there are advantages to the short url, especially because adding a + to the end of a bit.ly address gives you access to the stats for that page.

I'd already planned to use a few Kickstart style incentives as I had done with my lake swim.  The more people gave the more they got in return.  Donations over £25 got you access to the livestream of the event on the night (I'd no idea how to do this yet), more than £50 and you got to have something written on me for the world to see.  It's a simple formula but it works well.


### Just Giving
They're not my favourite platform, but they work well and people are very familiar with them.  There were a few things which I learnt along the way too:

* There's no way to send an email to everybody who donated other than in the thank you message.
* You can get just about everybodys email address by going to your page > "Edit Your Page" > "See all donations to your page" and then manually copy and pasting (don't forget to BCC)
* Their page config means that when you share their links the title is rubbish and generic, not the title of your page, so you have to edit ti every, single, damned, time.

## Spreading the word

### Making the most of your first time

The first thing I did once I had the page created and in reasonable nick was to add links to it from my Twitter profile and to post it to Facebook.  Both obvious but easily forgotten.  The nature of the Facebook timeline means posts are often not seen by a lots of people, and that the first time you post something it is more likely to be shown to people, so make the most of this first post.  I tagged in a few bearded friends (more likely to understand the pain of my planned evening) to help draw people in.  I also replied to every comment.

### Keeping the network expanding

I am genuinely thankful every time somebody donates and amazed at the generosity of friends and complete strangers.  Every time somebody donated I tried to thank them via an appropriate media.  If we were friends on Facebook I wrote on my wall  tagging them in (thus it's seen by my friends and them lus possibly their friends).  If it was twitter I made a public tweet not a DM.  Each time I included the BitLy link so that as friends of friends saw the post they too might donate.  The only time I didn't do this was if a donation was anonymous and then I tried to privately message the person.


### Keep adding content

I did a few updates along the way (there was a 2 month run up to the event) to help boost the signal and to entertain people who'd donated.  This included explaining I'd stopped all shaving activity and posting a beard/body hair progress shot.

### Roping in external help

Just like tagging in bearded friends on Facebook I went to seek out those who would understand my pain.  Top of that list was the brilliant and thoughtful dating site for beard lovers, [Bristlr](http://www.bristlr.com/).  I got in touch and asked if they'd run a blog post about what I was up to and they agreed.  As they said themselves [We don’t often promote shaving – as beard fans it really goes against what we’re all about. But we can always make an exception, especially when it’s for a great cause](http://blog.bristlr.com/the-shaving-of-oli-wood/).  One of the things I've always admired in Bristlr is the thought they put into gender, relationships and sexuality.  I hoped my thoughts on the effects of shaving would be of interest to them.

## Sorting it out on the night

Beautician (my old chum Leeanne) and location sorted (the wonderful [The Nest in Low Fell](https://www.facebook.com/TheNestLowFell/)) there were a few things to sort on the night, namely video livestreaming.

After a lot of fiddling with Google Hangout (difficult to share), YouTube Live (has to be tied to a Google+ account and difficult to restrict) I ended up tweeting my woes and had old hand Christian [@documentally](https://twitter.com/documentally) suggest [bambuser.com](http://www.bambuser.com).  After a quick nose about it looked like they would do the job nicely.  I'd originally wanted a very private livestream (password protected ideally) but this turned out to be pretty difficult without getting everybody to sign up to the same service in advance.  Bambuser however allows you to embed your feed into a page as an iFrame, so I threw up a quick page on here, didn't link to it and away we went.

The Bambuser app is excellent to use and so long as you can remind people to keep the phone landscape, all is well.  There's a live count of the number of people watching too which is fun.

Shaving and waxing aside, the night went very smoothly.


## The wrap up

After it was all over and I'd recovered a bit (two hours and forty minutes of having your hair ripped out by the roots is exhausting) I tried to make the most of the tail.  Retweeting tweets (using the "quote tweet" method to add in a hashtag and the bit.ly link) helped drive a few more donations.  Reposting and thanking people on Facebook picked up a few more.

One thing that amazed me was how many people knew nothing about it, despite me tweeting, posting and sharing it far more than I was comfortable.  It's obvious that Facebook pretty heavily filters people's streams.  Even good friends only saw it after the event when I shared photos.

I downloaded the Bambuser video and then removed it (I don't want this online forever), downloaded all the Facebook photos and imported them into Shotwell on my laptop and last of all wrote this.  Now onto next years challenge.

## The tech list

There's nothing I've done that most geeks won't roll their eyes at, but put together it's been pretty effective.

* Just Giving for donations
* Twitter and Facebook for promotion
* Bit.ly for link shortening and tracking
* Bambuser for live streaming









I stuck to Just Giving again.
