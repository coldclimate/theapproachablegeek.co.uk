title: Clustering locations
---
A local marketing agency had a huge wealth of postcode data from a mailing list that they needed to make sense of.  Where were these places? Did they cluster in certain areas?  Where should they focus their attentions.

Over the course of a few hours, I was able to clean up the data (remove duplicates, strip out the malformed postcodes etc), and then format it so that the online mapping service [ZeeMaps](http://www.zeemaps.com/) could import it and see those patterns emerge.

The result â€“ it turns out that half of city in question is ruled out, and most of the postcodes cluster around a few streets, so instead of printing and delivering leaflets to the whole city, only about a quarter were required saving cost, trees and wasted effort.
