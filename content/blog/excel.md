title: Using Excel to 'hack' Edinburgh Fringe data
---
A quick and dirty bit of data analysis using my tool or choice, Excel (and more specifically pivot tables).  This is a really rough cut and I’ll be running the data through [Google Refine](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) (which I’ve just been introduced to), but here’s the first cut of How Rude Are Countries.  It’s taken from [2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe](http://culturehackscotland.com/data) performance data provided via festivalslab and collates the Adult Content Warnings against the country of origin.
