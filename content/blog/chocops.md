Such is the nature of an office at Christmas, there were several large boxes of chocolates knocking about.  I jokingly organised them into groups, forming a bar graph reminiscent of the [NOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) screens that hover above our team.  Everybody laughed, jokes were made about the OCD nature of our team, and chocolates got eaten.

However as the day went on, I noticed that the layout of the chocolates was affecting what I chose.  There were very few toffee pennies (my favorite) so I nabbed a couple (I made sure to leave one).  There were lots of the coconut ones, so I munched on those, my politeness getting the better of me and no wanting to finish the strawberry cremes which everybody seemed to enjoy.  Maybe it was just me, but I think other people found the same thing.

The next day there was a new box of chocolates, so I did the same, only this time I went for a rudimentary pie graph, and something interesting happened; I no longer get any actionable information from it.  I couldn't tell which were running low at a glance for example.  Other people in the office also seemed to spend less time choosing, suggesting that they too were getting less information from the layout.

It's daft I know, but I've never before seen such a clear example of the difference between data and information, or how the choice of display so greatly affects how quickly and easily you can get the actionable information you need.
