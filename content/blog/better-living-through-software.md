title: Better living though software

I'm not a man to make new years resolutions, but I do try and spend a bit of time every January decluttering my life.  
This year I realised that I'd ended up using various online services to make this happen.

## Sorting out my spending

I've signed up to [MoneyDashboard.com](http://www.moneydashboard.com) and hooked it up to my bank accounts.  It imports your bank statements and you mark up each transaction into a cetegory (household bills, going out, birthday present etc) and over time you get a picture of how, where and when you spend.  Unlike [You Need A Budget](http://www.youneedabudget.com) (which several friends swear by) MoneyDashboard is an online service rather than desktop based and is retrospective in nature - it tells you how you've spent your money, not whther or not you're going to over spend.

## Keeping track of things I need to do

In this [excellent article on 24 Ways](http://24ways.org/2013/home-kanban-for-domestic-bliss/) Meri explains how she and her wife use a Kanban board to keep track of all the things they need to do and how this reduces tension, frustraion and the stress off knowing you've a tonne of stuff but not knowing where to start.

I've taken to using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to run a couple of Kanban boards (house, life, work, etc), some of which are shared with my girlfriend.  The mobile app is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello&hl=en_GB) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/trello-organize-anything/id461504587) (we've one of each) and free.  As and when things come up they get added and a ticket in the appropriate board, and at the moment I stick my nose into it once or twice a day.  

By knowing everything I need to do it in Trello I've stop worrying about forgetting things, very comforting.

## Looking less scruffy

One of the great joys of working for a little tech company is that I can get away with wearing cords and a hoodie most of the time.  The downside is I look a scruff most of the time.  I hate shopping for clothes, I never know what actually suites me and spending a Saturday in the Metrocentre fills me with dread.

So, I joined [Thread.com.](https://www.thread.com/Uu8996617800)  It's an online style agency.  You click on pictures of people who you like the style of and upload a photo of you (for an idea of body size).  They you drag a few sliders around to say how much you would spend on certain items (do people really spend Â£500 on a pair of jeans?).  They match you up with a styling (mine is called Sophie, she seems to have excellent taste) and every few weeks they send you some outfits by email which you can rate and buy indevidual items from.

The thing I really like about Thread is that when you mark to say you don't like an item you can say why eg. I don't wear watches, it's too expensive, I don't like the colour.

So far I've ordered a couple of items and they were delivered quickly and beutify packed.  Here's hoping this time next year I'll not look like a bum.

Note: the Thread link above means you and I get a fiver off if you join.

## Shopping for food more efficiantly.

We get a [fantastic meatbox](http://www.gandsorganics.com/) delivered once a month from a local farmer which is excellent, but shopping for other things is a bit of a pain.  Supermarkets are designed to make you buy more things, so goignt here cost you more money.

Step in the [ASDA app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asda.android&hl=en_GB).  The basket doesn't seem to time out, so as we run out of things or as I'm planning the weeks food I add items to the basket and then checkout once I'm ready.  Rather than booking a home delivery slot I choose the "click and collect" option which means that I can drop in on my way home and it's all ready to go.
