title: One stop adulting list
---

Sometimes being an adult is a pain in the neck becaue you're expected to have a bunch of *stuff* to mean you can do a bunch of *dull things*.  I never seem to have the right things, so I started building a list every time I had to buy something.

They're all [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree?tag=wwwcoldclimat-21) links (and naturally, they're affiliate links so I make a few pennies if you order via the links)

Many thanks to all those who contributed.  Those who I can link to are [Jon i4Details](http://www.i-4detail.co.uk/)(who's a tremendous car detailer in the North East) and Ruth Ball (author of [Rough Spirits & High Society: The Culture of Drink](https://amzn.to/2HoqeYk) and [Rebellious Spirits: The Illicit History of Booze in Britain](https://amzn.to/2IIdKdC))
