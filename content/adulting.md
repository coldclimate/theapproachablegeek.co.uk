title: One stop adulting list
---

Sometimes being an adult is a pain in the neck becaue you're expected to have a bunch of *stuff* to mean you can do a bunch of *dull things*.  I never seem to have the right things, so I started building a list every time I had to buy something.

They're all [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree?tag=wwwcoldclimat-21) links (and naturally, they're affiliate links so I make a few pennies if you order via the links)


### Stationary things

* [A4 envelopes](https://amzn.to/2uYFw3u) - for posting of legal things which you shouldn't fold
* [A5 envelopes](https://amzn.to/2GIifbt) - for posting everything else
* [Parcel tape](https://amzn.to/2Juajbr) - because nothing does the job of sealing up parcels as well
* [Sharpie](https://amzn.to/2JvmNzU) - there is no better marker pen

### DIY things

* [Bathroom sealent](https://amzn.to/2JpU3IJ) - at somepoint you'll need to replace it because it's gone manky
* [Paint scraping knife](https://amzn.to/2HifKK1) - super helpful for lots of things  Today  I used mine to fold down the sharp edged ittle tab things on the back of a picture frame
* [A tape measure](https://amzn.to/2JtXAWc)
* [A decent screw driver](https://amzn.to/2GM9LzW) - Have one quality multitool rather than a collection of crap ones
* [A set of pliers](https://amzn.to/2qkZ9hB) - with a wire stripping edge in them
* [Adjustable wrench](https://amzn.to/2qfQE7f) - for wretching things
* [A saw](https://amzn.to/2qgnN20)
* [Drain unblocker](https://amzn.to/2uYJMju) vicious chemicals at their finest
* [WD40](https://amzn.to/2JuDc7B) - for loosening things you need to wretch
