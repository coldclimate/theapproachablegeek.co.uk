    <p>I’m Oli Wood (and as I write this, I’m 31) and I run The Approachable Geek.  I’m keenly involved in the North East tech scene, and in the last year have spoken at <a href="http://www.supermondays.org/">Super Mondays</a> events and helped curate and compare Design It Build It <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2010/dibi/">2010</a> and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/dibi/">2011</a> and then ran all of <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/dibi/">2012</a>.</p>

<p>Before setting out on my own I spent 2 years at The BGroup in Newcastle heading up all of the digital side of the agency and before working for bgroup I worked at Accenture for three years on several large projects.</p>

<p>Prior to gainful employment I spent four years at Durham University leaving with a Masters in Computer Science and a trail of websites and involvement with my college.</p>

<p>Before university I built websites for a glass company in the late 90’s, you can find my employment history and hopefully a few nice words about me, on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/oliwoo">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Cumbria, and outside of work can normally be found listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen.</p>
