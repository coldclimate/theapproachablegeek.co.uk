    <h1>Helpful technical advice from a real person</h1>

<p>If you’ve ever found yourself in need of a translator to help you navigate the sea of jargon, hype and multitude of options that everybody faces when they start to investigate technology, I might be able to help.</p>

<p>I can help you get to grips with how to make the most of the wealth of technology that is available to you.  I’m not going to try and steer you down one path (I don’t sell or provide actual technology solutions) and I’ll give you a straight answer if I don’t think we can help.</p>
