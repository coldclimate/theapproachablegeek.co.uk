    <p>If you think I might be able to help, get in touch and lets chat about it, I’m always open to new things, however these are my core skills if you will.</p>

<h2 id="backend-development">Backend development</h2>

<p>The front end of a website is the bit you see, and it’s probably written in a combination of language namely HTML and CSS.  I know my way round both, but I’m no designer.</p>

<p>The backend of a website is the code and databases which make it work and spit out HTML+CSS for your browser to consume.  This is wehere I am most happy.  I’m a PHP developer primarily working with CodeIgniter.  I also use things like Python and shell scripting to crunch data.</p>

<h2 id="put-development-infrastructure-and-processes-in-place">Put development infrastructure and processes in place</h2>

<p>If you’re building an online business or writing software there are things you should have in place from the outset including configuration management, database backups, deployment mechanisms and monitoring of resources.  I’ve been involved in several start-up businesses and have helped get them get and running smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="automation-of-data-processessing">Automation of data processessing</h2>

<p>I’ve saved companies hundred of man hours of manual entry and “by eye” correction using a wide and varied toolbox (normally involving some text manipulation tools, Excel and a shed load of text files).  If you’ve got a database you need to get data in or out of, or a mountain of information in a difficult format, I can probably help.</p>

<h2 id="working-on-why-your-website-doesnt-work">Working on why your website doesn’t work</h2>

<p>If you’ve got a site up and running, and nobody is visiting (or worse still you don’t know who or how many people are visiting), I can help.  I’m not an SEO consultant (but I know my way round), and I’m not a Social Media consultant (but I have been running blogs for 10 years).  I do understand how to build successful sites however.</p>
