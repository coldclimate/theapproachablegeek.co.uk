 <p class="created_at">August 7, 2012</p>
 <p>A lot of people I know (mostly of a certain generation) still hesitate before buying online and often not because of fears of online security but customer service. “What do I di if it’s broken? How do I take it back to the shop?” are valid questions.</p>

<p>Some companies get this very wrong (Ebuyer, I am looking at you here) but just recently two suppliers have got it complete right.</p>

<p>I lost my <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> whilst helping clear out the house of a deceased relative. It was on the other side of the country, and on a very stressful day, it’ probably got pinged off my trouser pocket whilst I was dragging a sofa round or something similar. I <a href="https://twitter.com/coldclimate/status/227656376950870016">tweeted about how sad I was</a> when I noticed that evening.</p>

<p>Fitbit’s UK team <a href="https://twitter.com/FitbitUK/status/228055324760870912">noticed and replied</a>, suggesting I get in touch with their US support team. I dropped them a slightly confused email and a week later a brand new FitBit, exactly the same as the one I’d lost, came through my door. Amazing.</p>

<p>Last night I got home to my favorite surprise of the month, my <a href="http://www.thelarderbox.com/">Larder Box</a>. Larder Box is a subscription service who send you tasty treats every month. It’s an offshoot of Love Your Larder, a local start up. Sadly my Larder Box had not travelled well (I blame the delivery company here) and as a result the box was crushed on one side and the lid had come off the Bacon Jam resulting in a sticky mess. I dropped an email to Larder Box just to let them know (they should know if their delivery company has screwed up right?) and got a reply within minutes from the founder asking for a photo and saying a replacement box would be on it’s way to me asap.</p>

<p>Customer service isn’t lacking online, it’s thriving, and technologies such as Twitter, <a href="http://uservoice.com/">Uservoice</a>, <a href="http://customersure.com/">CustomerSure</a> and plain old email are really helping to nail it. I can’t think of a shop who would have done what FitBit did for example.</p>
