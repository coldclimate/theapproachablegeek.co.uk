    <h1><a href="/blog/twitter-for-authors/">Twitter for authors, a session for New Writing North</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">October 21, 2010</p>
 <p>In October 2010 I delivered a half day session at the amazing <a href="http://community.newcastle.gov.uk/libraries/">Newcastle Library</a> on behalf of <a href="http://www.newwritingnorth.com/">New Writing North</a> to a group of authors interested in getting started with Twitter and using it more effectively.</p>

<p>The Newcastle Library for those who’ve not been, is an amazing new building, and quite the busiest library I’ve ever seen. As <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/coldclimate">a dedicated reader</a> it warms my heart to see not just the computers getting used, but plenty of people missing about the stacks. The staff too were extreamly helpful getting me signed up, and thus signed into their wifi.</p>

<p>As it turned out all of the authors in attendance were already signed up for Twitter and had accounts, so the test accounts I have available for people to play with and learn on were not needed. They were all however a little hazy on the fine details of the difference between tweets, re-tweets, the subtleties involved in @replies and hashtags. We also covered things like geolocation (new that week to Twitter) and New Twitter, which is still in it’s early stages.</p>

<p>The session was designed not just to introduce Twitter and how to use it, but also to look into some of the writing projects that are going on via twitter at the moment includes <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dinner_guest">dinnerguest</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/goodcaptain">goodcaptain</a> and the proliferation of Haiku in 140 characters of less. A good deal of the session was also used to cover how authors, who are in effect small businesses, could use twitter to help promote their work</p>

<p>All in all a very successful day, and nice to meet a few new faces too.</p>
