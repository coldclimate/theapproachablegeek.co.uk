    <h1><a href="/blog/wordpress-plugin/">Building a Wordpress plugin to communicate with customers more clearly</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2010-10-21</p>
 <p>Through a series of short projects I’ve been working with Jason Brownlee of Dollywagon to help them the company use their existing website to present information to clients. Dollywagon’s Influence Engine maps out online content and connection, identifying the most influenced nodes and a wide range of other invaluble informationanalyses social media networks and point-point the most influential members on any online community. The data that it produced is full of detail and difficult to present to clients.</p>

<p>Dollywagon had an existing WordPress plugin which functioned for some datasets, but not others. Working in small discrete steps, I was able to perform two roles.</p>

<p>As the liaison between the business client-facing and the number crunching teams, my role was to translateing business needs into technical requirements and, reducing headaches on both sides. As a backend PHP developer I was able to
first modify the existing WordPress plugin to bring in some new functionsality, and then to develop a new plugin which that will can be extended in the future. The new plugin provides is more capable and flexible and canmore functionality as works across many different datasets, which is no mean technical feat.</p>

<p>The latest development of the plugin allows clients to click and add notes to the existing data directly within the web browser, thus eliminating the need for speadsheets to be passed back and forth, and providing a more compelling and less error-prone user experience.</p>

<p>WordPress is a great blogging platform and a pretty impresivesing content management systems, but it is through the power of plugins, both
freely available and custom built, that it can be used for more than just static websites.</p>
