    <h1><a href="/blog/2011/">2011 Annual Report</a></h1>
 <p class="created_at">2011-12-28</p>
 <p>Yes, the title is a little bit silly, but it’s been a fun year so I thought it was time to reflect a little.</p>

<p>2011 started with me taking a few months out from The Approachable Geek to form and built a new company.  Over the first 4 months of the year <a href="James Rutherford">weddingtales.co.uk</a> was born, shaped, coded and launched along with <a href="http://www.creativenucleus.com/">James Rutherford</a> though <a href="http://vimeo.com/differenceengin">The Difference Engine</a>.  By the end of 2011 we’ve handled over 1,500 wedding guests and nearly 10,000 wedding photos.</p>

<p>Whilst building <a href="http://weddingtales.co.uk/">weddingtales.co.uk</a> I did a few consulting jobs, mostly data thrashing including preparation for a huge Sage data import (155,000 product records needed cleaning before they got into the system)  and some quick and dirty Excel data jobs too.</p>

<p>In March I had one of my most challenging yet rewarding jobs of the year delivering a one day course for 12 to 17 years olds getting them up and running with Arduino circuit boards (and vibrobots).  A really tough day (for me) but one of the most satisfying.</p>

<p>The early summer saw some more Excel jobs, including reducing the hours a local estate agency spent matching payments to tenants by as much as 15 hours a week by building a smarter and more automated spreadsheet.  I also helped deliver the Blog It! masters course for Newcastle University, learning a lot about the common problems non-techies face with using domestic IT kit along the way.</p>

<p>Late summer though to the end of the year has had be focussing on two main projects, one writing complex data-capture scripts and social data storage mechanisms and the other being my most challenging project to day – running the Design It Built It conference.  More on that another time,</p>

<p>2012 is virtually upon me and as I type this I’m booked up until April which is a pleasant situation to be in.  DIBI is going to take up a lot of time, as is a new longer running project, but more news on that another time.</p>
